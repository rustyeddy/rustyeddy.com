        This series of articles breaks down the Software Development Lifecycle Phases which is basically a series of best practice processes used to efficiently build software in a cost effective and highly visible manner. By highly visible, I mean a manner in which non-software developers such as product owners, users and managers can understand and track the progress of a software project they have a vested interest in.

<p>I had a great idea to help my wife maintain her massive succulent
collection by building a self watering garden. This project would
consist of three primary components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <em>soil sensor</em> is a piece of hardware that she could place in
dirt to measure the soil moisture and a small pump to water the dry
soil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>controller</em> that will collect moisture data from all the soil
moisture sensors and provide a user interface to track moisture
levels and manually control the pump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>cloud</em> element such that the data could be accessed and pump
controlled from anywhere.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Turns out my brilliant idea is not all that unique, a quick search on
google turns up a bunch of similar projects. Oh well, maybe not unique
but useful still.</p>
<p>The thing that struck me about most of these projects is that they are
built as a single, self contained watering station. I am a little more
ambitious in that I want to control a whole yard full of watering
stations and be able to control them from anywhere in the world!</p>
<p>There is a little bit of hardware to be built and a whole lot of
software to be written. I am not a hardware guy so I&rsquo;m going to hack
together a prototype or two to get this project rolling.</p>
<p>However, I am a software professional (don&rsquo;t laugh it&rsquo;s true!), so why
not handle this like a real software project that I would do in my day
job.</p>
<p>The process goes a little like this:</p>
<h2 id="the-phases-of-the-software-development-lifecycle">The Phases of the Software Development Lifecycle</h2>
<p>We are going to break down this particular project, as well as all
software development project into three primary phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Development</li>
<li>Delivery</li>
</ol>
<p>These three phases are certainly linear but I want to make it really
clear, there are iterative cycles within each of these phases and
amoung the phases collectively.</p>
<p>As matter of fact that the iterative nature of this development
process is at the heart of true <em>Agile Software Development</em>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s jump into each of these phases just a little deeper.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-design-phase---getting-started">The Design Phase - Getting Started</h2>
<p>I had Kelly describe to me in high level, non-technical detail the
various ways she wanted to use the product. She described the various
activities in a user story form.  For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a gardner I need to set different watering levels for different
plants. The low soil moisture level turns the water pump on and the
high moisture level turns the water pump off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Todo: place a link to the various other user stories.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases-and-requirements">Use Cases and Requirements</h3>
<p>These user stories are typically refered to as
<a href="/software/use-cases/"><em>use cases</em></a>, which are will establish the
direction of the entire rest of the software development
project. These use cases allow us to start pulling out the
<em>requirements</em> and start drafting up the <em>Software Architecture</em>
document.</p>
<h3 id="wire-frames-story-boards-and-the-user-experience">Wire Frames, Story Boards and the User Experience</h3>
<p>Along with the use cases Mini, our <em>front-end</em> developer was able to
start sketching out the user interface in the form of <em>Wireframes</em>
collected to together in <em>story boards</em> that helped walk Kelly through
the <em>Use Cases</em> giving Kelly (and us developers) a mutual, solid
understanding of what it would be like to use the software <em>visually</em>
not just by description providing a clear and complete <em>User
eXperience</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why tell somebody when you can show them!</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="design-guide-manifest-and-sitemap">Design Guide, Manifest and Sitemap</h4>
<p>Mini also created the <em>design guide</em> that included colors, fonts and
spacing that defines the over-all aesthetic of the site. Finally a
<em>site map</em> was created to identify the pages of the User Interface and
the hiearchial relationship of the pages to one another.</p>
<p>A <em>manifest</em> was also created as a list of all assets that occupy the
UI / Website such as images, pictures, PDF documents and so on. (This
project does not actually have any PDFs but you get the picture).</p>
<h3 id="database-design---the-model">Database Design - The Model</h3>
<p>The Use Cases gives our Database Guru Melanie the ability to start
drafting the <em>Data Model</em> which describes the various data chunks
the app needs, where the data is stored and the data chunks
relationship to one another. We will constantly be referring to our
<em>data model</em> throughout the development of this application.</p>
<h3 id="test-cases">Test Cases</h3>
<p>By stating the <em>requirements</em> in a way that tell us what tasks need to
be <em>validated</em> in a way that is concrete, measurable and very
specific. We are going to call the <em>acceptance tests</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Acceptance Tests</em> will be our guiding light, every feature or
change we make to the software needs to be validated by a specific
test or two.</p>
<p>As the Use cases and hence requirements change due to user
interaction, <em>which they surely will</em>, our tests will also change
accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-have-so-far">What do we have so far?</h2>
<p>From our <em>Use Cases</em> we were able to derive:</p>
<ul>
<li>The applications requirements</li>
<li>An Architecture Document</li>
<li>Wireframes, Storyboards and Design Guide</li>
<li>Our Data Model</li>
<li>Validation Criteria and Acceptance Tests</li>
</ul>
<p>By staying disciplined and doing our proper homework we have gathered
plenty of information to derive our initial <em>requirements</em> enough that
we are now able form measurable <em>Test Cases</em>.</p>
<p>Wow we gotta lotta stuff to work with now! Certainly enough to get
started doing the actual development.</p>
<p>But before we get started doing the actual development we need to
prepare a couple tools to help keep us focused and provide visibility
into the progress we are making.</p>
<p>These tools are going to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our Todo list aka Kanban board</li>
<li>Software Repository aka <em>Version Control System</em></li>
<li>Test rig</li>
</ol>
<p>OK, let&rsquo;s get our prep on!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="preparing-for-development">Preparing for Development</h2>
<h3 id="the-kanban-board---the-mighty-driver">The Kanban Board - The mighty driver</h3>
<p>From the <em>requirements</em> and <em>story boards</em> we were able to create a
series of works items (or todo list) in the form of a <em>Kanban board</em>.</p>
<p>The kanban board is a wonderful way to visually display what needs to
get done, what is being worked on and what has been accomplished.</p>
<p>OK. This has been a lot of work and we have made great progress
<em>planning</em> the project. With out Kanban board in place, we need to
setup one more thing, our Version Control System (VCS) before we get
into the thick of actual development.</p>
<h3 id="the-version-control-system-vcs">The Version Control System (VCS)</h3>
<p>In preparation to start developing the software the first important
task is getting the <em>Version Control System (VCS)</em> ready to go. The
VCS in our case will be <em>git</em> hosted by <em>github</em>.  The VCS will
provide the <em>single source of truth</em> and keep a history of every
single change, who made that change and when.</p>
<h3 id="the-test-rig">The Test Rig</h3>
<p>We are going to setup a test environment to that allows us to easily,
thrououghly and painlessly test our software as we continue through
development. It is OK if the tests start out semi-manually, but we are
going to want to get as close to 100% thouroughly testing <em>all</em> of the
software that gets <em>committed</em> to our released product.</p>
<p>Our automated tests will become part of our delivery system, known in
the industry as our Continuous Integration/Continuos Delilvery (CI/CD)
Pipeline. In modern times the CI pipeline is tightly integrated into
our version control system.</p>
<p>We will go through some very specific examples as this project
unfolds.</p>
<p>Excited right? I know, me too!!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-development-phase">The Development Phase</h2>
<p>Finally the fun part, time to get crackin!</p>
<h3 id="pick-a-task-and-create-a-branch">Pick a Task and Create a Branch</h3>
<p>It is time for me to pick the top task from the <em>Todo</em> (some people
like to call it the back log) column of <em>Kanban board</em> and move it to
the <em>In Progress</em> column, letting everybody know what I am working
on. It also gives everybody a quick visual into what current tasks,
and how many items are being actively worked on at any given moment.</p>
<p>With our first task at hand it is time to check out a fresh version of
the (empty) software from the VCS system. The first thing I am going
to do is create a <em>feature branch</em> and start writing up a <em>test case</em>
or three depending on the complexity of the task.</p>
<p>As we know, the test cases are going to be litmus that tells us wether
our coding effort has correctly implemented the associated
requirement.  It will serve two other purposes, first it will live
with the code forever more giving us confidence as the code base grows
larger and more complex that future changes are not going break
something that was working correctly does not break.</p>
<p>If done wisely, it can also act as a way to automate the <em>dev loop</em>
making our: edit, compile, test, debug cycle making it <em>sooooo</em> much
more convinient to develop these features.</p>
<h4 id="the-developers-loop">The Developers Loop</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s speak about the <em>dev-loop</em> a bit. Some people mistakenly
consider this tightly grouped activities the SDLC
itself. While this important set of actions are at the core of
software development we can clearly see (from the rest of this
article) these activities can be done in a vacuum and deliver the
correctly implemented software project in and of itself.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>      +-----&gt; Compile ------+
      |                     |
      |                     v
    Edit                  Test ==&gt; Success! ==&gt; Pull/Merge Request
      ^                     |
      |                     |
      +------- Debug &lt;------+
</code></pre><p>Many developers, myself included will start creating code a bit at a
time, incrementally adding code that gets me closer and closer to
successfully completing my task at hand.</p>
<p>At first there will be incremental additions that get the task closer
to complete, but along the way there are many small mistakes that are
iteratively corrected as I code.  Until the ultimatel success!</p>
<p>Depending on the complexity of the task this loop can be iterated over
hundreds of times, that&rsquo;s why making it as efficient as possible will
be a huge win over the coarse of the development.</p>
<h3 id="the-gui-down">The GUI Down</h3>
<p>In the mean time the UI team consisting of Mini is cranking through the
user interface code with a mocked back end getting the whole UX flow
together. Iterating through screen designs, tweaking the Style Guide
all the while responding to the regular user feedback she is getting.</p>
<h3 id="back-to-the-backend">Back to the Backend</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say our developer Joan, after a few iterations has completed the
feature developement and all tests cases finally pass, yea!</p>
<p>At this point she will commit the code to the <em>feature branch</em> and
<em>push</em> the branch to the server where she will then create a <em>Pull
Request (PR)</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Pull Request (PR) in github also known as a <em>Merge Request (MR)</em>
in gitlab</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Pull Request (PR)</em> or <em>Merge Request (MR)</em> is the next step to
getting the code officially accepted or <em>merged</em> into the <em>master</em> or
<em>main</em> branch, which is typically the branch used to officially
release software.</p>
<h3 id="pull-requests-tests-and-peer-reviews">Pull Requests, Tests and Peer Reviews</h3>
<p>However before the new code can be officially <em>merged</em> into main line
and eventually released two important things must happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A series of automated tests will be fire off and all tests must
pass ensuring the new code does not break old functionality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code needs to be reviewed by other developers also known as
peer review ensuring the code adheres to agreed upon coding
standards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="automated-tests">Automated Tests</h4>
<p>Both the automated tests including the new tests must pass ensuring
all new and old code run correctly and no <em>regression bugs</em> have been
introduced. These automated tests can also be a good place to add
things like <em>static analysis</em> and <em>code coverage</em>.</p>
<h4 id="peer-reviews">Peer Reviews</h4>
<p>Likewise the code will also be <em>Peer Reviewed</em> by a colleague or two.
Let&rsquo;s say we have two additional developers Bob and Brenda also
experienced developers, we&rsquo;ll have Bob and Brenda look over Joans new
code.</p>
<p>If they see things that do not adhere to coding standards, or create
potential future problems Bob and Brenda can make comments on the code
that Joan will have to address, either defending her given code or
making appropriate changes sending her back to the &ldquo;Edit -&gt; Debug -&gt;
Test&rdquo; cycle mentioned above.</p>
<h3 id="merge-on-to-main">Merge on to Main</h3>
<p>At long last, the automated tests all pass and the peer review passes,
pheeeww! Those peer reviews can be a bit stressful at times. But
finally the code is <em>Merged</em> into the <em>Main</em> branch. Victory!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move that card over to the <em>Done</em> list on the Kanban board!</p>
<p>To note: the tests Joan had written to validate this new feature will
become part of the automated tests from now forevermore ensuring this
feature does not get damaged during future modifications.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="lifecycle-phase-delivery---ship-it">Lifecycle Phase Delivery - Ship It</h2>
<p>The code in the main branch is either released automatically via an
automated CI/CD Pipeline or is acculmulated with other changes until
it has been completed and married up with the User Interface complete by
Mini&rsquo;s team.</p>
<p>We now have a real live application <em>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</em> or
on a smaller scale a <em>Minimum Viable Feature (MVF)</em> is ready to hit
the streets.</p>
<p>The project is now in the hands of real users doing real work, or at
least it is ready to be&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>
<p>How the software / new feature is deployed depends greatly on the type
of software project.  If it is an online SaaS app the deployment
procedure might be to constantly push incremental changes to a subset
of servers or users during a short vetting period.</p>
<p>If the software is an application that runs on a computer or cell
phone there may be officially versioned release cycles with versioned
(1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 2.1, etc) binaries built for different systems
(Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi)</p>
<p>Or it may be an embedded system requiring a firmware upgrade. The
SDLC is very similar leading up to this point. It is the <em>delivery</em>
phase that really changes significantly depending on the application
that has been built.</p>
<p>We will cover these various types of delivery mechanisms in other
articles that focus on the particulars.</p>
<h3 id="feedback---features-requests-and-bugs-reports">Feedback - Features Requests and Bugs Reports</h3>
<p>Regardless of how and where the software is deployed, if it is used or
at all successful you will receive feedback on the software. The
feedback can be good, but it will mostly likely be a negative if not
downright nasty.  That is because human nature we tend to be more
vocal about things that make us mad.</p>
<h4 id="bug-reports">Bug Reports</h4>
<p>The feedback we receive can be loosely catagorized as <em>bug reports</em>
when features simply do not work correctly or some unwanted outcome.</p>
<h4 id="feature-requests">Feature Requests</h4>
<p>On a more positive note the reports may comeback in the form of a
<em>feature request</em> where new functionality is being asked for.</p>
<h4 id="bug--feature-tracking">Bug / Feature Tracking</h4>
<p>In either case we need perhaps another tool to track bugs and feature
requests. Often known as a <em>Bug Tracking</em> tool, there are numerous
varieties out there including but (definently) not limited to:</p>
<p><em>Github</em> and <em>Gitlab</em> both have <em>issues</em> built right into the VCS with the
ability to integrate software changes with specific changes to the
software aka merges.  Issues are pretty simple but more than adequate
to get the job done.</p>
<p>Other for pay tools like <em>Jira</em> are quite popular in corporate
environments, much more sophisticated often to the point of being
confusing.</p>
<p>There are numerous other options, but the key here is that we need a
tool that can track bugs and requests, priortize development and guess
what: place on our <em>Kanban</em> board to be prioritized with other tasks
right back into the <em>Design Phase</em> of our <em>Software Development
Lifecycle</em>.</p>
<p>Did I say that software development is an <em>iterative process</em>?</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?</h2>
<p>This was a real quick or maybe not so quck overview of a software
development project <em>inspired</em> by real events. Much detail and nuance
were left out to keep the story flowing and not become a novel.</p>
<p>However, if pratical application of software develop practices is
something you need to get started, improve upon or just interested in
I have started creating articles for each of the topics above to dive
into more <em>practical detail</em>, not theory but <em>real world examples</em>
with usable advice.</p>
<p>If so you will see a series of articles below that will dive into real
world practical discussions about each of these phases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning the detailed articles are a work in progress! Not all of the
articles are complete and all will be updated regularly as this
rapidly changing world of software development evolvses.</p>

                After all the planning time has come to change code. What happens now?  Clear evidence of a rookie team is the lack of a Version Control System (VCS) tool and associated processes built around your VCS will provide all the visibility you need to track progress of your software project. Your VCS becomes the source of truth for your project.

                All software must take data in, send data out and store data in one manner or another. How the data will be structured and inter-related is a key element of pretty much all software projects.

                Once code has gone through the long process of being made ready for the end user it is time to let them have it.  But it is not over yet, bug reports and feature requests will start to flow in, you best be ready for them!

                I am a developer with modest design skills on a good day, and no formal training in the great arts of Design and User eXperience. However, I have compiled a set of BPs that allow the non designer in me to produce good looking and professional UIs at least I think so, what do you think?.
