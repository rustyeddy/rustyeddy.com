        This series of articles breaks down the Software Development Lifecycle Phases which is basically a series of best practice processes used to efficiently build software in a cost effective and highly visible manner. By highly visible, I mean a manner in which non-software developers such as product owners, users and managers can understand and track the progress of a software project they have a vested interest in.

	    <h2 id="an-tale-of-software-development">An Tale of Software Development</h2>
<p>Kelly got ahold of me wanting some software developed for a self
watering garden system that Mark had designed. The hardware is composed
of a soil moisture and temperature sensor with a chip that has a wifi
to communicate with an external <em>controllor</em>. It also has a pump that
can be controlled by dry soil or manually from an app on a phone.</p>
<p>The process went a little like this:</p>
<h2 id="the-design-phase---getting-started">The Design Phase - Getting Started</h2>
<p>I had Kelly tell me how the product was meant to do. She describe all
the various ways the software was going to be used, case by case in
high level (non-technical) detail. These <em>user stories</em> Kelly told
we were able to break out all the <em><strong>use cases</strong></em> into
individual descriptions on the various ways the product was going to be
used.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases-and-requirements">Use Cases and Requirements</h3>
<p>From the use-cases we were able to derive the initial set of
<em>requirements</em> and the begin drafting the <em>Software Architecture
Document</em>.</p>
<h3 id="wire-frames-story-boards-and-the-user-experience">Wire Frames, Story Boards and the User Experience</h3>
<p>Along with the use cases Mini, the <em>front-end</em> lead was able to start
sketching out the user interface in the form of <em>Wireframes</em> collected
to together in <em>story boards</em> that walked Kelly through the <em>Use
Cases</em> giving Kelly (and us developers) a mutual, solid understanding
of what it would be like to use the software, not just by description
but walking her through the usage visualy, providing the complete
<em>User eXperience</em>.</p>
<h4 id="design-guide-manifest-and-sitemap">Design Guide, Manifest and Sitemap</h4>
<p>Mini also created the <em>design guide</em> that included colors, fonts and
spacing that defines the over-all aesthetic of the site. Finally a
<em>site map</em> was created to identify the pages of the User Interface and
the hiearchial relationship of the pages to one another. The
<em>manifest</em> was also created as a list of all assets that occupy the UI
/ Website such as images, pictures, PDF documents and so on.</p>
<h3 id="database-design---the-model">Database Design - The Model</h3>
<p>The Use Cases gives our Database Guru Melanie the ability to start
drafting the <em>Data Model</em> which will describe the various data chunks
the app will need, where the data is stored and the data chunks
relationship to one another. We will constantly be referring to our
<em>data model</em> throughout the development of this application.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-have-so-far">What do we have so far?</h2>
<p>From our <em>Use Cases</em> we were able to derive:</p>
<ul>
<li>The applications requirements</li>
<li>An Architecture Document</li>
<li>Wireframes, Storyboards and Design Guide</li>
<li>Our Data Model</li>
<li>Validation Criteria and Acceptance Tests</li>
</ul>
<p>So we got a lotta stuff to work with now! Enough to get started doing
the actual development.</p>
<p>But how do we know we get it right once we start building?</p>
<h3 id="test-cases">Test Cases</h3>
<p>By stating the <em>requirements</em> in a way that tell us what tasks need to
be <em>validated</em> in a way that is concrete, measurable and very
specific. We are going to call the <em>acceptance tests</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Acceptance Tests</em> will be our guiding light, every feature or
change we make to the software needs to be validated by a specific
test or two.</p>
<p>As the Use cases and hence requirements change due to user
interaction, <em>which they surely will</em>, our tests will also change
accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="the-kanban-board---the-mighty-driver">The Kanban Board - The mighty driver</h3>
<p>From the <em>requirements</em> and <em>story boards</em> we were able to create a
series of works items (or todo list) in the form of a <em>Kanban board</em>.</p>
<p>The kanban board is a wonderful way to visually display what needs to
get done, what is being worked on and what has been accomplished.</p>
<p>OK. This has been a lot of work and we have made great progress
<em>planning</em> the project. With out Kanban board in place, we need to
setup one more thing, our Version Control System (VCS) before we get
into the thick of actual development.</p>
<h2 id="the-development-phase">The Development Phase</h2>
<h3 id="getting-ready-to-go---version-control-system-vcs--">Getting Ready to go - Version Control System (VCS) -</h3>
<p>In preparation to start developing the software the first important
task is getting the <em>Version Control System (VCS)</em> ready to go. The
VCS in our case will be <em>git</em> hosted by <em>github</em>.  The VCS will
provide the <em>single source of truth</em> and keep a history of every
single change, who made that change and when.</p>
<h3 id="pick-a-task-and-create-a-branch">Pick a Task and Create a Branch</h3>
<p>Joan takes the first item from the Kanban board and moves it from the
<em>Todo</em> column over to the <em>In Progress</em> column, letting everybody know
what she is currently working on, I do the same.</p>
<p>Joan checks out a fresh version of the (empty) software from the VCS
system, creates a <em>feature branch</em> and starts writing up some
<em>tests</em> to validate the task she is going to start working on before
she starts writing code for the actual feature she is going to
develop.</p>
<h4 id="the-developers-loop">The Developers Loop</h4>
<p>Joan then starts writing code with the goal of passing the tests, she
then gets into what I like to call the <em>dev-loop</em>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code> +-&gt; Edit -&gt; Compile -&gt; Test -&gt; Debug -+
 |                                     |
 +&lt;------------------------------------+
</code></pre><h3 id="the-gui-down">The GUI Down</h3>
<p>In the mean time the UI team consisting of Mini is cranking through the
user interface code with a mocked back end getting the whole UX flow
together. Iterating through screen designs, tweaking the Style Guide
all the while responding to the regular user feedback she is getting.</p>
<h3 id="back-to-the-backend">Back to the Backend</h3>
<p>Back to Joan: after a few iterations and expanded tests cases all
tests finally pass!</p>
<p>At this point Joan commits the code to her <em>feature branch</em> and
<em>pushes</em> the branch to the server where she will create a
<em>pull request</em> (also known as a <em>Merge Request</em> in gitlab) that will
allow Joans new code to be scrutinized by peers.</p>
<h3 id="pull-requests-and-peer-reviews">Pull Requests and Peer Reviews</h3>
<p>The <em>Pull Request</em> sets off an automatic / automated series of systems
tests that when they pass will grant the code the ability to be
merged into main, provided Joan&rsquo;s changes pass <em>peer review</em>.</p>
<p>Joan&rsquo;s code will also need to be <em>Peer Reviewed</em> by a couple colleges.
Bob and Brenda also sharp developers will scrutinize Joans code, if
they see things that do not adhere to coding standards, or create
potential future problems Bob and Brenda can make comments on the code
and that Joan will have to address, either defending her given code or
making appropriate changes sending her back to the &ldquo;Edit -&gt; Debug&rdquo;
cycle above.</p>
<h3 id="the-main-merge">The Main Merge</h3>
<p>At long last, the peer review passes and the code is <em>Merged</em> into the
<em>Main</em> branch.  Victory. Let&rsquo;s move that card over to the <em>Done</em> list
on the Kanban board!</p>
<p>To note: the tests Joan had written to validate this new feature will
become part of the automated tests from now forevermore ensuring this
feature does not get damaged during future modifications.</p>
<h2 id="lifecycle-phase-release---ship-it">Lifecycle Phase Release - Ship It</h2>
<p>The code in the main branch is either released automatically via an
automated CI/CD Pipeline or is acculmulated with other changes until
it has been completed and married up with the User Interface complete by
Mini&rsquo;s team.</p>
<p>We now have a real live application <em>Minimum Viable Product</em> or
<em>Minimum Viable Feature (MVF)</em> is ready to hit the streets.</p>
<p>The project is now in the hands of real users doing real work, or at
lease it is ready to be&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="feedback---features-requests-and-bugs-reports">Feedback - Features Requests and Bugs Reports</h3>
<p>New features are being requested, tweaks to existing features and an
occaisonal bug is found. All of this feedback is collected in a bug
tracking system and added to back to the Kanban board where this whole
process continues.</p>
<p>Did we say that software development is an <em>iterative process</em>.</p>
<h2 id="want-more">Want More?</h2>
<p>This was a real quick overview of a software development project
<em>inspired</em> by real events. Much detail and nuance were left out to
keep the story flowing and not become a novel.</p>
<p>However, if pratical application of software develop practices is
something you are interested in, would like to start doing better. I
have started creating and will continue to add a lot more content
diving into more <em>practical detail</em> on each one of these topics.</p>
<p>If so, continue on to my &ldquo;Phases of the Software Development
Lifecycle&rdquo; and we will jump into each of these topics in more detail
including some very explicit examples of each phase.</p>

Clear evidence of a rookie team is the lack of a Version Control System (VCS) tool and associated processes built around your VCS will provide all the visibility you need to track progress of your software project. Your VCS becomes the source of truth for your project.

                                Developers when programming use VCS to create a temporary private branch to work from to avoid negatively effecting others while changing code. The developer and rest of the team rely on Software Testing to ensure new and changed code does what is required of it, and the new code MUST NOT break existing functionality. Getting testing right has many profound positive effects on the project, let me explain.

                                Once code has gone through the long process of being made ready for the end user it is time to let them have it.  But it is not over yet, bug reports and feature requests will start to flow in, you best be ready for them!

However, I have compiled a set of BPs that allow the non designer in me to produce good looking and professional UIs at least I think so, what do you think?.
