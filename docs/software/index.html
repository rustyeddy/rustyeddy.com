<h2 id="headline-1">
How to Start
</h2>
<p>
It is amazing how many complex and expensive software projects start
with nothing more than a <em>proof of concept</em>. 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-2">
Objective
</h3>
<p>
The first things above all is to state a clear, measurable
objective. It should go without saying, the objective must also be
reasonable. 
</p>
<p>
Believe it or not, I have seen people post (on Upwork) jobs asking to
create a <em>Facebook Like</em> website for $500. Sheesh, I wonder if <em>Mark</em>
(Zuck to you outsiders…) knows he way over paid to build
<em>Facebook</em>.?. 
</p>
<p>
Back to the point.. By setting clear, measurable and realistic goals
does a <em>boat load</em> of good things that we&#39;ll get into in bit, but one
of the most important things is:
</p>
<p>
&gt; You position you and your team to succeed! 
</p>
<h4 id="headline-3">
<span class="todo">TODO</span>
Keep the Objective Clearly Posted
</h4>
<p>
This most likely seems like a trivial thing to do, Even a bit
managerial. However it can Save a tremendous amount of time and energy
Heading downTechnical rabbit trails And fixing weird bugs That may
have otherWise Been avoided altogether By selecting an alternative
solution By simply having the endgame in mind. 
</p>
<h4 id="headline-4">
Establish Communication Protocol
</h4>
<p>
Communication should be:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
easy for everybody
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
captured to context, history for example, to capture the rationale
behind decisions that may have required a controversial
trade-off. Invaluable for repeating the same convesation. 
</p>
<p>
Also can be used to determine when old practices can be
obsoleted. Technology has a way obliterating completely rational
decision that were made a mere two years ago..
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
DO NOT Allow project communications To be spread amongst email,
Texts, Social media accounts and various Other arbitrary Cyber
nooks and crannies.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
You will Lose all history and context. Debates and decisions Will be
unnecessarily repeated.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-5">
Define a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
</h3>
<p>
Focus on building something usable at first. Forget all the features
And sexy designs, Just make sure you have something that&#39;s Necessary
and usable.
</p>
<p>
Easy and bug free always win over Doing sexy features.
</p>
<p>
Build something usable With the minimum features to have a happy
customer, With relatively bug free software. (Low tech debt).
</p>
<p>
Now start iterating on features.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-6">
<strong><strong>Draft</strong></strong> Milestones and Tasks
</h3>
<p>
Expect them to change <em>they will anyway</em>.
</p>
<p>
Milestone should each add something usable to the project. When
necessary, Milestones will be associated with deadlines and target
dates. 
</p>
<p>
Milestones are also good time For intermittent payment. 
</p>
<p>
Make An effort to improve Estimates and guesstimates. 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-7">
Advanced Topic - Separate POC from Development
</h3>
<p>
A POC is taking a conceptAnd demonstrating that it can actually be
done in hardware and/or software. And implementation is
takingApproving POC And turning it into something usable To somebody
other than the developer. 
</p>
<p>
Embrace this fact, And projecting software Development times and cost
Become much less mysterious. 
</p>
<h4 id="headline-8">
<span class="todo">TODO</span>
Create an example PoC to Development
</h4>
<p>
Was it Rodney Brooks that Said Plan on Throwing away your first
version. Because you will anyway.
</p>
<p>
I Believe the motive behind this was simplyThe fact that Software
development takes on to very different Trajectories Depending on
whether you are buildingA known entity, Or are exploringA new
development or concept.
</p>
<p>
The POC is really about Going from not knowing what you don&#39;t know,
Two knowing what you need To do. In the process of going from POC to
implementation Is identifying that what you do know And associating
that with Established industry patterns And best practices. 
</p>
<p>
To Basically starting a development job not knowingWhen if or
howYou&#39;re going to accomplish the desired goal.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-9">
Communication Parity
</h3>
<p>
The Ultimate goal here is communication parity. The two key factors to
communicating and keeping parity Is the clarity of communication,
Which should be reflected in the milestones and Tasks, In the captured
history. 
</p>
<p>
Best results happen when buy-in comes fromAll interested
parties. Owners, Stakeholders, Providers And even management. 
</p>
<p>
Communications should resemble a web vs. a tree, communications do not
need to Real-time in most cases. ButResponses absolutely need to
be Timely In order for the process to continue Finish on time.

<p>
But before we scatter to our cubes and bury our heads behind
terminals, let&#39;s all agree to get on the same page by choosing a set
of tools (manual or electric) that we all are going to agree on using
in a <em>consistent and collaborative way</em>!
</p>
<p>
It is even more amazing the number of <em>professionals</em> that still make
local copies to files of all sorts and then attempt to <em>synchronize</em>
all change by emailing files back and forth.

Good Job Keeping Files Organized
</h3>
<h3 id="headline-2">
Next Up Treating Your Customers with Respect (They will appreciate it!)
</h3>
<p>
Please: <strong><strong>DO NOT</strong></strong> recruite your customers to be your <em>QA</em>
department. Especially if they are unanaware, thinking they are
getting a <strong><strong>usable</strong></strong> piece of software.
</p>
<p>
It is time to start adopting a <em>Test Driven Development (TDD)</em>
mindset. Even if you are knee deep into an existing development
project, get started building out our TDD now!
</p>
<h3 id="headline-3">
Test Driven Development

<h4 id="headline-4">
Dev Testing

<h4 id="headline-5">
System Testing

<h4 id="headline-6">
Acceptance Testing 
</h4>
<p>
The big umberlla. Give the big boss a place they can weigh in on their
concerns.  Also, give your customer the assurance they need. If the
software does not work out to their satisfaction, they can always
smash the <strong><strong>Not Accepted</strong></strong> button.
</p>
<p>
Of course, they will be requested to give a full and descriptive
reason behind the failed test. 
</p>
<p>
&gt; This is NOT a technical problem. This is a communication problem!
(Most likely).
</p>
<h4 id="headline-7">
Test Plans For Everyone
</h4>
<p>
Test Plans also help Ensure that the milestones and tasks Are
adequate. Well done test plans Tend to expose Gaps in software
architecture And in turn the planning process. 
</p>
<p>
It is critical that everybody Including management Understand the
tests And sign off on the test plans. 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-8">
Before Development comes a Test Plan!
</h3>
<p>
Do not start development before you have a test plan. Period. 
</p>
<p>
It can be simple, And it will not be complete, But it must precess
any development, And is required Prior to acceptance testing.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-9">
Lets Automate Everything!
</h3>
<p>
OK! We will try to. But lets Except the very real probability. That we
won&#39;t be able to automate hundred percent Of everything Out of the
gate. And we may very well Be advised To perform manual testing.
</p>
<p>
Always. And Thouroughly.
</p>
<p>
Not testing for any reason Is not acceptable. The only acceptable
answer tonight testing Is no delivery.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s More than enough To motivate us To automate As completely And
thoroughly as possible.

Glad to hear testing is going well!
</p>
<p>
Now it is time to Get the soccer out to the users For the real
test. This test is measurable Buyer customers feedback 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-1">
Good Software is Continually Improved
</h3>
<p>
The greater the success software Is directly proportionate to The
number of features that are requested As well as the number of bugs
that are found. 
</p>
<p>
&gt; Bug reports means your softwar is getting used.!.
</p>
<p>
That is obvious if people are happy using a software That they might
have some requests that would flow in from time to time. 
</p>
<p>
What might seem counterintuitive is the fact that, Even well done
successful software will have bugs. Period. Good teams understand and
embrace that… The Bugs will be fixed And the customers will be even
happier 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Bad software that is really buggy We&#39;ll never
really get used (the day of Micro$oft FUD are happy fading in the
past). 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-2">
Customer Expect Seamless Updates 
</h3>
<p>
Rolling out new versions of software to your users in a manner that
does not make their life a nightmare should be your primary goal!
</p>
<p>
Customers do not want forklift style updates to their
software. Certainly the days of having to backup all your dataMaybe
even back up your entire computer hard drive, Uninstall a previous
version of the software Hold your breath, Type in A 64 character
nonsensical string of gibberish, Click start, Listen to the CD start
the world. 
</p>
<p>
Hold your breath, And watch a number of minutes of a progress bar is
tick by.
</p>
<p>
And if all a successful you smileLittle little bit of breath out,
Opened version of the software hope everything is okay. Going to the
file menu to open up your backed up data, 
</p>
<p>
Hold your breath again, Click load And hope to high heaven and it read
your old data correctly.
</p>
<p>
If So all is well carry-on.
</p>
<p>
If not, Call customer support, Prepare to wait for Possibly hours, Oh
and by the way Have your credit card ready to go, Just in case.
</p>
<p>
Support ain&#39;t free..
</p>
<h3 id="headline-3">
Nope, that ain&#39;t good no more..
</h3>
<p>
Now on the other hand logging to want to Google&#39;s things And look
aroundNo doubt some things of changed on you.  Okay baby they went a
little overboard, We need to find somewhere and write the middle.
