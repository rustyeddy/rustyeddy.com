With at least a first slash at some milestones and goals that the
entire team can huddle around. 
</p>
<h2 id="headline-1">
Let&#39;s roll up our sleeves and get Buzzin!
</h2>
<p>
But before we scatter to our cubes and bury our heads behind
terminals, let&#39;s all agree to get on the same page by choosing a set
of tools (manual or electric) that we all are going to agree on using
in a <em>consistent and collaborative way</em>!
</p>
<p>
It is even more amazing the number of <em>professionals</em> that still make
local copies to files of all sorts and then attempt to <em>synchronize</em>
all change by emailing files back and forth.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-2">

<p>
We are in the <code>20th century folks!</code>, I mean the 21st century! Let&#39;s
get our <em>shit together</em> and start using /version

<h2 id="headline-5">
How to Start
</h2>
<p>
It is amazing how many complex and expensive software projects start
with nothing more than a <em>proof of concept</em>. 
</p>
<h2 id="headline-6">
Objective
</h2>
<p>
The first things above all is to state a clear, measurable
objective. It should go without saying, the objective must also be
reasonable. 
</p>
<p>
Believe it or not, I have seen people post (on Upwork) jobs asking to
create a <em>Facebook Like</em> website for $500. Sheesh, I wonder if <em>Mark</em>
(Zuck to you outsidersâ€¦) knows he way over paid to build
<em>Facebook</em>.?. 
</p>
<p>
Back to the point.. By setting clear, measurable and realistic goals
does a <em>boat load</em> of good things that we&#39;ll get into in bit, but one
of the most important things is:
</p>
<p>
&gt; You position you and your team to succeed! 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-7">
<span class="todo">TODO</span>
Keep the Objective Clearly Posted
</h3>
<p>
This most likely seems like a trivial thing to do, Even a bit
managerial. However it can Save a tremendous amount of time and energy
Heading downTechnical rabbit trails And fixing weird bugs That may
have otherWise Been avoided altogether By selecting an alternative
solution By simply having the endgame in mind. 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-8">
Establish Communication Protocol
</h3>
<p>
Communication should be:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
easy for everybody
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
captured to context, history for example, to capture the rationale
behind decisions that may have required a controversial
trade-off. Invaluable for repeating the same convesation. 
</p>
<p>
Also can be used to determine when old practices can be
obsoleted. Technology has a way obliterating completely rational
decision that were made a mere two years ago..
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
DO NOT Allow project communications To be spread amongst email,
Texts, Social media accounts and various Other arbitrary Cyber
nooks and crannies.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
You will Lose all history and context. Debates and decisions Will be
unnecessarily repeated.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-9">
Define a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
</h2>
<p>
Focus on building something usable at first. Forget all the features
And sexy designs, Just make sure you have something that&#39;s Necessary
and usable.
</p>
<p>
Easy and bug free always win over Doing sexy features.
</p>
<p>
Build something usable With the minimum features to have a happy
customer, With relatively bug free software. (Low tech debt).
</p>
<p>
Now start iterating on features.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-10">
<strong><strong>Draft</strong></strong> Milestones and Tasks
</h2>
<p>
Expect them to change <em>they will anyway</em>.
</p>
<p>
Milestone should each add something usable to the project. When
necessary, Milestones will be associated with deadlines and target
dates. 
</p>
<p>
Milestones are also good time For intermittent payment. 
</p>
<p>
Make An effort to improve Estimates and guesstimates. 
</p>
<h2 id="headline-11">
Advanced Topic - Separate POC from Development
</h2>
<p>
A POC is taking a conceptAnd demonstrating that it can actually be
done in hardware and/or software. And implementation is
takingApproving POC And turning it into something usable To somebody
other than the developer. 
</p>
<p>
Embrace this fact, And projecting software Development times and cost
Become much less mysterious. 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-12">
<span class="todo">TODO</span>
Create an example PoC to Development
</h3>
<p>
Was it Rodney Brooks that Said Plan on Throwing away your first
version. Because you will anyway.
</p>
<p>
I Believe the motive behind this was simplyThe fact that Software
development takes on to very different Trajectories Depending on
whether you are buildingA known entity, Or are exploringA new
development or concept.
</p>
<p>
The POC is really about Going from not knowing what you don&#39;t know,
Two knowing what you need To do. In the process of going from POC to
implementation Is identifying that what you do know And associating
that with Established industry patterns And best practices. 
</p>
<p>
To Basically starting a development job not knowingWhen if or
howYou&#39;re going to accomplish the desired goal.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-13">
Communication Parity
</h2>
<p>
The Ultimate goal here is communication parity. The two key factors to
communicating and keeping parity Is the clarity of communication,
Which should be reflected in the milestones and Tasks, In the captured
history. 
</p>
<p>
Best results happen when buy-in comes fromAll interested
parties. Owners, Stakeholders, Providers And even management. 
</p>
<p>
Communications should resemble a web vs. a tree, communications do not
need to Real-time in most cases. ButResponses absolutely need to
be Timely In order for the process to continue Finish on time. 
</p>

Next Up Treating Your Customers with Respect (They will appreciate it!)
</h2>
<p>
Please: <strong><strong>DO NOT</strong></strong> recruite your customers to be your <em>QA</em>
department. Especially if they are unanaware, thinking they are
getting a <strong><strong>usable</strong></strong> piece of software.
</p>
<p>
It is time to start adopting a <em>Test Driven Development (TDD)</em>
mindset. Even if you are knee deep into an existing development
project, get started building out our TDD now!
</p>

<h3 id="headline-20">
Acceptance Testing 
</h3>
<p>
The big umberlla. Give the big boss a place they can weigh in on their
concerns.  Also, give your customer the assurance they need. If the
software does not work out to their satisfaction, they can always
smash the <strong><strong>Not Accepted</strong></strong> button.
</p>
<p>
Of course, they will be requested to give a full and descriptive
reason behind the failed test. 
</p>
<p>
&gt; This is NOT a technical problem. This is a communication problem!
(Most likely).
</p>
<h3 id="headline-21">
Test Plans For Everyone
</h3>
<p>
Test Plans also help Ensure that the milestones and tasks Are
adequate. Well done test plans Tend to expose Gaps in software
architecture And in turn the planning process. 
</p>
<p>
It is critical that everybody Including management Understand the
tests And sign off on the test plans. 
</p>
<h2 id="headline-22">
Before Development comes a Test Plan!
</h2>
<p>
Do not start development before you have a test plan. Period. 
</p>
<p>
It can be simple, And it will not be complete, But it must precess
any development, And is required Prior to acceptance testing.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-23">
Lets Automate Everything!
</h2>
<p>
OK! We will try to. But lets Except the very real probability. That we
won&#39;t be able to automate hundred percent Of everything Out of the
gate. And we may very well Be advised To perform manual testing.
</p>
<p>
Always. And Thouroughly.
</p>
<p>
Not testing for any reason Is not acceptable. The only acceptable
answer tonight testing Is no delivery.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s More than enough To motivate us To automate As completely And
thoroughly as possible.

<p>
Glad to hear testing is going well!
</p>
<p>
Now it is time to Get the soccer out to the users For the real

</p>
<h2 id="headline-25">
Good Software is Continually Improved
</h2>
<p>
The greater the success software Is directly proportionate to The
number of features that are requested As well as the number of bugs
that are found. 
</p>
<p>
&gt; Bug reports means your softwar is getting used.!.
</p>
<p>
That is obvious if people are happy using a software That they might
have some requests that would flow in from time to time. 
</p>
<p>
What might seem counterintuitive is the fact that, Even well done
successful software will have bugs. Period. Good teams understand and
embrace thatâ€¦ The Bugs will be fixed And the customers will be even
happier 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Bad software that is really buggy We&#39;ll never
really get used (the day of Micro$oft FUD are happy fading in the
past). 
</p>
<h2 id="headline-26">
Customer Expect Seamless Updates 
</h2>
<p>
Rolling out new versions of software to your users in a manner that
does not make their life a nightmare should be your primary goal!
</p>
<p>
Customers do not want forklift style updates to their
software. Certainly the days of having to backup all your dataMaybe
even back up your entire computer hard drive, Uninstall a previous
version of the software Hold your breath, Type in A 64 character
nonsensical string of gibberish, Click start, Listen to the CD start
the world. 
</p>
<p>
Hold your breath, And watch a number of minutes of a progress bar is
tick by.
</p>
<p>
And if all a successful you smileLittle little bit of breath out,
Opened version of the software hope everything is okay. Going to the
file menu to open up your backed up data, 
</p>
<p>
Hold your breath again, Click load And hope to high heaven and it read
your old data correctly.
</p>
<p>
If So all is well carry-on.
</p>
<p>
If not, Call customer support, Prepare to wait for Possibly hours, Oh
and by the way Have your credit card ready to go, Just in case.
</p>
<p>
Support ain&#39;t free..
</p>
<h2 id="headline-27">
Nope, that ain&#39;t good no more..

<p>

<h3 id="headline-31">
Do you wonder why programmers who are supposed to be sooo smart can&#39;t seem to remember shit? 
</h3>
<p>
I can&#39;t count the times I&#39;ve told a team member what we are doing, or
in a meeting, mention a particular task that needs to be addressed,
only to find three weeks lather that nothing has been accomplished.
</p>
<p>
It is just about enough to make me want to start writing things down.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-32">
How to get everybody on the same page
</h4>
<p>
If you want to <em>be a part of</em> a functional team that benefits from
your leader ship, I suggest you make it clean
</p>
<p>
By clearly stating a) The single most important objective of the
project, which must be reasonable. Followed by b) first pass at establishing clear
and measurable milestones.
</p>
<p>
Measurable, means that can at very minimum be counted as done.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-33">
Have You started Scheduling Pizza Runs 2:00am the night before a realease?
</h3>
<p>
Every release, you swear you will apply the lessons learned from this
and previous mistakes to never repeat them resulting in predictable
stress free releases.
</p>
<p>
However, you are still ordering Pizza at 2:00am, not so because of
hunger, more so to ease the intense coffee buzz zinging in your head
yer the ol tummy a bit nautious. 
</p>
<p>
That is not a good comb with the pre-release stress knowing the
success of the company is directly related to the success of your
this software project.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-34">
Why are programmers always talking gibberish, no matter what country they are from? 
</h3>
<p>
Would it it strike fear in your heart if the doctor responsible
for saving your life only spoke <em>Gaelic</em>?
</p>
<p>
Well, can&#39;t imagine it feels any better knowing your team of
engineers, the ones responsible for the success of the software
project, and infact <strong><strong>directly</strong></strong> responsible for the success of your
company only speak <em>techalic</em>? (at <em>Galelic</em> can be translated with
help of the Internet)
</p>
<h3 id="headline-35">
Ah, I can go on for hours
</h3>
<p>
As I <em>jot</em> these thoughts down, endless stories, lessons and anecdotes
flood my brain. Alas, me little fingers only move so fast..
</p>
<p>
So I will not go on for hours, rather, I suggest that you:
</p>
<h4 id="headline-36">
Embrace the Process
</h4>
<p>
It will set you free! Believe it or not! 
</p>
<p>
If you embrace <em>a process</em>, I am <em>not</em> talking about a intrusive oger
of tasks and reports that amount to throwing 6 inches of molases on a
race track just before a 100 yard dash.
</p>
<p>
No, not that, but 
</p>
<h4 id="headline-37">
Just Enough Process (JEP)
</h4>
<p>
Yep, <em>Just Enough Process (JEP)</em> to keep the entire team organized,
tasks and goals <em>clearly</em> stated and all vital communication recorded
for accuracy and perhaps posterity.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it is possible, not easy, but quite doable!
</p>
<h1 id="headline-38">
Process Your Problems AWAY!
</h1>
<p>
Through JEP you can start gaining a sense of clarity that will lead to
a team huddled around a single and unified goal. All with a
clear vision of a <strong><strong>successful outcome</strong></strong> looks like, with the passion
to move the project to the only real definition of <strong><strong>success</strong></strong>: a joy
filled customer!
</p>
<h2 id="headline-39">
My Best Practices
</h2>
<p>
Here are the <em>most</em> important elements of a <em>successful software
project</em>, IMHO. The following list is far from exhaustive, hell we
don&#39;t have the room (or enough of your or my attention) to cover
everything, but.
</p>
<p>
Following these guidelines will get you off to a good start.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-40">
Clarity and Unification toward a single Goal
</h2>
<h3 id="headline-41">
The One Goal
</h3>
<p>
The best thing you can do as a leader is establish a clear, reasonable
and measurable goal. That can be quadrupled if the team can align
their values and passion to something that can really be done.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-42">
Milestones
</h3>
<p>
The first step in this process is to take a first pass at
Milestones. Milestones will set the pace and priority for which the
application comes together. 
</p>
<p>
As we get more into this process, we will consider <em>best practices</em> to
<strong><strong>accurrately</strong></strong> predicting software cost. 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-43">
The Reality of Budgets and Schedules
</h3>
<p>
This will apply equally well to the schedule. I may have some thoughts
on this topic that sound a little radical, but if you let the logic
play out, you&#39;ll may find your perspective on the matter of schedule
and budget to shift getting something useful from the project ASAP.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-44">
Staying in Sync
</h2>
<p>
Getting a diverse team of techies, designers, writers and managers on
the same page emitting high voltage energy to the project is a great
accomplishment, well done!
</p>
<h3 id="headline-45">
Channeled Energy
</h3>
<p>
With all that energy MUST be <em>choreographed</em> not necessarily
orchestrated (more on this later), in the right, positive direction.  
</p>
<p>
An amazing accomplishment, Congrats3!
</p>
<p>
But don&#39;t let the team burn out of control! The last thing we want are a
bunch of race cars making up the race track during the race. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps a better analogy would have been a team of Klydsdales pulling
a wagon toward the drivers destination is more appropriate, but the
thought of equating high paid developers with caged animals seemed a
little condescending.
</p>
<p>
Sorry, I do loose track at times (feel free to tell me to speed things
up a bit, by the way..).
</p>
<h3 id="headline-46">
Version Control is The Foundation of Software
</h3>
<p>
Period. Without version control you have a mess or <em>ping.c</em>!.  
</p>
<p>
The cool thing is, version control is all the rage!!! Every developer
worth their salt has a github account (whether they use it or not), I
suggest everybody involved in the software development process do the
same. 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-47">
Build Your Process Around Your Development Team
</h3>
<p>
Developers are likely amoung largest expense, why not make them  as
efficient (and as happy, they may give you a $2/hr discount) by
accepting the fact that you don&#39;t have to be a developer to benefit
from processes that originated from the software industry.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-48">
Rustys Wacky Views
</h4>
<p>
Someday, software development tools and processes are going to
transcent just the software development community, for good reason.
</p>
<p>
Smart managers will embrace this and loose the fear of <em>all things
programmer</em> and understand enough to be on sync with perhaps your most
valuable asset.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-49">
Testing
</h2>
<p>
Please: <strong><strong>DO NOT</strong></strong> recruite your customers to be your <em>QA</em>
department. Especially if they are unanaware, thinking they are
getting a <strong><strong>usable</strong></strong> piece of software.
</p>
<p>
It is time to start adopting a <em>Test Driven Development (TDD)</em>
mindset. Even if you are knee deep into an existing development
project, get started building out our TDD now!
</p>
<h3 id="headline-50">
Before Development comes a Test Plan!
</h3>
<p>
Do not start development before you have a test plan. Period. 
</p>
<p>
It can be simple, And it will not be complete, But it must precess
any development, And is required Prior to acceptance testing.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-51">
Test plans Tie to Milestones and Tasks
</h3>
<p>
Now here is where we get some slickness going. We are going to create
a test or tests (as many as needed) that will tie back to the tasks
and milestones that we have began to layout.
</p>
<p>
As the tests are passed, and the code is commited to the repo, we can
check another well done task off, getting us closer to our milestone
and hence goal.
</p>
<p>
This also begins to give us insight to <em>realistic</em> development
times. Letting us adjust our predictions for the next time around. 
</p>
<h2 id="headline-52">
Deploy and Updates
</h2>
<p>
Well now that code has passed <em>acceptance</em>, that is, as soon as it is
<em>acceptable</em> for your customers to have:
</p>
<h4 id="headline-53">
SHIP IT!
</h4>
<p>
But, goodness, gracious, Again DO NOT make this painful on your
peeps. Updates should come easy. That&#39;ll keep them happy for sure! 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-54">
Bugs will exist
</h3>
<p>
Even the cleanest home is going to have a bug somewhere, right? Yep,
same for software. We are going to embrace the bug, and then squish it
(electronically of course).
</p>
<p>
This will re-inforce your clients love for you. The rare bug they
do encounter get squashed and a fixed promptly and transparently roles
out to your customers. 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-55">
Success demands New Features 
</h3>
<p>
Your users will be so happy and confident in the software, they will
be expecting wonderful new features to be rolling out. 
</p>
<p>
They don&#39;t want to wait for them, nor do they want the old features to
break! 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-56">
A seemless, zero touch upgrade experience will be GREATLY appreciated! 
</h3>
<p>
Zero Touch! The holy grail of complicated software and network
systems.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-57">
Capturing Feedback
</h2>
<p>
Make it easy for customers to talk to us. We want bug Reports so we
can squash them little bastards.
</p>
<p>
We want feedback, nobody wants to work on levers and gadgets that
nobody is going to use. 
</p>
<p>
The best feedback we can get is always going to be the people that use
the software, oh yea, and the people that pay for it.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-58">
Adding Some Analytics
</h2>
<p>
Deployed software is a living being and needs to <em>live</em>
somewhere. Living spaces ain&#39;t free, a little bit of budgeting and
tracking can help you make decisions that will save lots of cash.
</p>
<p>
Also find weak links in your system that could be pissing your visitor
off. If we are pissing our visitors off, we at least better know why,
and most of them will not take the time to tell us whyâ€¦
</p>
<h1 id="headline-59">
Summary
</h1>
<p>
I have determined that I am going to start documenting and organizing
my <em>hobos bag</em> brain of <em>Software Development Best Practices (SDBP)</em>,
let&#39;s call it.
</p>
<p>
I have built this bag of experience, skill and opinions over many
years of working on, and leading <em>wonderously successful</em> and
<em>horribly tragic</em> software projects.
</p>
<p>
I certainly do NOT want to experience the <em>horribly tragic</em> projects
any longer, as well I do NOT want my clients to suffer anything of the
sort. 
</p>
<p>
So, at as base, I have documented the practices into <strong><strong>repeatable
processes</strong></strong> and hopefully, they get vetted by experience software
jockeys and managers alike.
</p>
<p>
Also, I would really like to hear, what you fear, or ailes you when
your knee deep in a software process.
