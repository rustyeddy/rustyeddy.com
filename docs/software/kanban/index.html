		<p>Kanban is fantastically simple. We will create a board with 3 columns,
<em>Todo</em>, <em>Work In Progress</em> and <em>Complete</em>.</p>
<p>Each column is populated with a single card for every task that must be
done. The cards are prioritized and move through the system as the
work progresses.</p>
<h2 id="good-kanban-reference">Good Kanban Reference</h2>
<p>My goal is NOT to describe Kanban itself. Instead, here is a good video
if you are not already familiar with it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO add a good reference video to how Kanban works</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The important things to take-a-way from the idea of Kanban is already acting as if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the tasks have been written in a 1-2 day granularity</li>
<li>the <em>board</em> is being updated regulary</li>
</ul>
<p>Then <em>everybody</em> will know exactly what progress has been made since the
last reference.</p>
<h3 id="task-lists-evolve">Task Lists Evolve</h3>
<p>We must embrace this fact: The tasks we began thinking about during
the <em>Customer Disovery</em> session while defining the <em>MVP</em> was probably
pretty accurate, but almost certainly <em>incomplete</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can not know, what you do not yet know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the most difficult aspects of building <em>novel</em> software.</p>
<p>The reality is that unforeseen issues will pop up that must be added
to our <em>Todo</em> list at any given time. We&rsquo;ll also find that many of our
original tasks were very high level and will necessarily need to be
broken down into smaller tasks.</p>
<h3 id="assigning-todo-items">Assigning Todo Items</h3>
<p>As a person with a particular skill becomes available they are
matched up with the next task on the to do list.</p>
<p>The task or the kanban card is then assigned to that particular
person and moved into the Work In Progress (WIP) list.</p>
<h3 id="tests-define-the-exit-criteria">Tests Define the Exit Criteria</h3>
<p>During this phase of the process, a deeper level of thought needs to
be put into the <em>tests</em> that must be written to establish a successful
completion of this task.</p>
<p>These tests will become part of the software itself, continuing for
evermore ensure to be run everytime a change is committed to the
source base, the quality of software consistently gets better.</p>
<h3 id="contstraints-on-the-wip">Contstraints on the WIP</h3>
<p>A <em>prioritized Todo list</em> and a <em>WIP</em> that allows only a single (or
two) item(s) per person, will help ensure that the progress of the project
is visible to everybody that cares to look.</p>
<h2 id="stacking-small-victories">Stacking Small Victories</h2>
<p>Keep the tasks small. A developer should be able to complete a task in
a day or two max. If tasks become three or four days they most likely
can and should be broken into smaller tasks.</p>
<p>This is important because the development team needs to see victories
and needs to have successes. Likewise, management needs to see
progress, and  customers need to experience new features and
improvements.</p>
<p>Eventually, the task is moved into the <em>Complete</em> column and the
software is delivered to the customer. (More on the software release
process later).</p>
<h3 id="github-projects">Github Projects</h3>
<p>Github provides a relatively new (2020) feature called projects,
that allow one to easily create a Kanban board. Github projects allow
users to create cards and track the github issues.</p>
<p>Your development team has access to this wonderfully integrated tool,
all for free right now.</p>
<p>Subscribe below if you would like help getting your team started.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO - Provide a screenshot</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="github-issues">Github Issues</h3>
<p>Project cards represent a big picture/high level view of the project
and how it progresses, whereas the <em>github issues</em> are the place to
keep the details of the the change requests, actions to recreate bugs
and support for new feature requests.</p>
<p><em>Github Projects</em> allow a single click to convert a <em>Card</em> into a
<em>Github Issue</em> which then keeps the <em>Project Cards</em> and <em>Issues</em> in
sync.</p>
<p>The integration of a Github Project board with the Github Issues is a
perfect combination of the right balance between communicating with
<em>non-technical</em> project stake holders and the more technical details
developers need to program by.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO - Screen shot github issues and project cards links.</p>
