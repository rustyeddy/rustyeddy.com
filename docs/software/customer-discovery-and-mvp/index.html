		<p><em>Customer Discovery</em> consists of one or more customer discovery
sessions, where all <em>users</em> and <em>owners</em> of the software will be
interviewed for their expectations, needs and desires for the
upcoming software project.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just stop at the first answer, it will be too vague. Dig deeper
and start peeling back the details. This great article on the
<a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm">Five Why&rsquo;s</a></p>
<h2 id="user-stories">User Stories</h2>
<p>The information gathered from these sessions are then articulated in a
series of <em>non-technical</em> descriptions of how the software is used by
everybody.</p>
<p>These descriptions of the software requirements are often referred to
as <em>User Stories</em>. Basically, each <em>story</em> walks through one of the
ways in which the <em>planned</em> software will be used.</p>
<h3 id="keep-language-plain">Keep Language Plain</h3>
<p>The project can be discussed and understood best when the conversation
is had in terms that the user is comfortable with.</p>
<p>It is important to keep the language common and avoid tech talk such
that <em>everybody</em> involved with the building and using the software can
participate in the conversation.</p>
<p>These user stories will later get broken down into specific tasks.</p>
<p>The real value to user stories is to create them like they are
recipes. Essentially software is about writing recipes with very
specific rules.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-ol-minimum-viable-product-mvp">The Good &lsquo;ol Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h2>
<p>An important result of the customer discovery session is a mutual
agreement on what the minimum or useful (viable) piece of software is and
which can be delivered as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the MVP is to get stuff out the door. We
specifically want to avoid <em>disconnected development teams</em>.</p>
<p>Software can be properly managed just like  construction project. That&rsquo;s only if the right processes and tools are established and enforced
throughout the product lifecycle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read The <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a> to really understand how to get specific about building a product your target market will be crazy about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an involved and very important topic. I&rsquo;m not going to attempt to
repeat or summarize them in this document, but we will assume that we
have a pretty clear picture of the application we are developing, at
least enough for now.</p>
<h2 id="tasks-are-small-and-measurable">Tasks Are Small and Measurable</h2>
<p>The tasks that we come up with must be completed within a day or
two. Any task that requires three days or more should probably be
broken down into smaller bite-size tasks.</p>
<p>We do not want to create tasks so that they&rsquo;re too big, ambiguous or
subject to misinterpretation. If your team is not making progress in a
day or two you should be able to know that immediately.</p>
<p>Keeping the granularity of tasks small allows the team to <em>start
stacking victories quickly</em> and more important, gives everybody a
chance to see when a software project is about to make a left turn.</p>
<h3 id="goals-are-most-effective-when-">Goals are Most Effective When &hellip;</h3>
<p>Goals do not have to be obnoxious, obtuse, vague or
pendantic. Just be real and reasonable.</p>
<p>If you want working software, provide a working set of goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Few in number, very targeted</li>
<li>Communicated in normal people language (user stories)</li>
<li>Provide users quick and immediate value</li>
<li>Prioritized to deliver <em>usable value</em> incrementally</li>
<li>Measurable and easy to determine when they are complete</li>
<li>Everybody understands and agrees with the Goals</li>
<li>Tasks should be 1-3 days max if possible (there will always be exceptions)</li>
</ul>
<p>All these tasks have to add up to the MVP. Anything that does not
directly and immediately get the software project closer to an MVP
must be avoided.</p>
