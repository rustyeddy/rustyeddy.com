The Big Idea
</h2>
<p>
Software development project will tend toward chaos, like most other
human sport involving more than two people. Unless of course those
team is bound by a <em>clear</em> and <em>common</em> vision.
</p>
<p>
Software development projects that are too focused on long term
deliveries that are, NOT within immediate reach risk diverging from
the end users need that it never gets used. Or almost as bad hated,
by customers.
</p>
<p>
Every project should be working toward a spefic
</p>
<h3 id="headline-2">

<p>
unless 
together by a common vision, clearified by a clear, 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Goals much be short term, realistic and measurable. 
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
&gt; No long term out of sight goals
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Only the <em>Customer</em> establishes the goal. A later during <em>testing</em>
approves the work during <em>acceptance test</em>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Are you (or have you) run a software project and are familiar with any
of these:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Software project schedule and/or budget are out of control.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
No idea how far along the software is progressing, or not.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Software teams seems to be out of sync.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The team morale decline and people leave, especially the good ones. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is age old wisdom dates back before Sun Tzu. Great leaders of all
ages have been knowing how to set an army (or team in our case) of
diverse peoples huddled around a common vision, a vision that <em>they
believe</em>, they can obtain.
</p>
<p>
A great software leader is much like (I imagine) the <em>cocksman</em> of a
rowboat needs to be. That is to make sure the boat is going in right
direction, ensuring all the energy of the individual rowers work in
unison, getting them closer to the goal, rather than a set of oars all
arbitrarily fighting against each other.

<h2 id="headline-3">
Are any of these problems familiar?

Team is in chaos and morale in decline

<p>
When the objectives are vague or frequently changing, it allows
shenanigans and <strong><strong>waste[1]</strong></strong> creep in, rapidly. Nothing will suck the
spirit out the a good team like waste! 
</p>
<p>
&gt; Which is just one reason to build a great team! Which is outside the
scope of this here paar.tic.u.lar docuement. [Todo: find some good
references on team building..].
</p>
<p>
[1] Waste is anything that does not benefit the customer (TODO get a
reference, I believe from the Toyota manual).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Measuring Progress, Quality and realistic cost to complete is
impossible. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Team members are not working on the most important tasks
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Direction keeps shifting according to unpredictable forces

<p>
Nobody is clear on Who we are building

The Solution
</h2>
<h3 id="headline-17">
Life Becomes Stress free when you are not overwhelmed with the things you
</h3>
<p>
Likewise, my life as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Developer</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Manager</span> has become
infinitely easier because I now focus my time, budget and resources on
fewer tasks.
</p>
<p>
Which means that It is also <strong><strong>MUCH EASIER</strong></strong> to ensure a <strong><strong>HIGH LEVEL</strong></strong>
of <strong><strong>Quality</strong></strong> when the feature scope has been minimized.
</p>
<p>
As a preface, before getting into the particulars of solving this
type of problem I would like to make it clear that this framework is a
direct [perhaps imperfect] reflection of the seminal works of Steve
Blank <em>Four Steps to Epiphany</em>  and Eric Ries and the <em>Lean Startup</em>,
as well as the <strong><strong>principals</strong></strong> of <em>Agile</em> development.
</p>
<p>
In a nutshell, both of these movements, as well as the myriad of other
similar movements in nearly every industry is all about maintaining
close and constant communication with your <em>user</em> iterating toward a
predicable and success conclusion to software projects.
