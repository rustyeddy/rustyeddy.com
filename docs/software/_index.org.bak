* Managing Predictable Software Development Projects

Are you are involved in a software development project that is
spinning out of control? Or maybe you want to keep from losing control?

If so, I created a cool little /Software Project Starter Kit/ you may
find helpful (and calming!). This guide is not about /programming/
rather is is all about the /process/ of **delivering** /production/
software. 

** The Process will Set You Free

I have worked on over a hundred software projects, a few great
successes, some honorable mentions, and a couple miserable failures. 

It has been my observation that succesfull projects all had /just the
right process/ in place. The failures varied from no process to too
much.  No process leads to choas, bugs and arguments. Too much process
kills efficiency, creativity and morale.

** Making Software Predictable

I am on a mission to define /Just Enough Process/ to keep projects
organized, predictable, efficient and a pleasure to work on. To that
end I have put together a 6-part series that will help take the
mystery and stress out of /managing software development/.

In this series I establish 6 critical resources that we will use to
build a workflow from 100% free tools (like github) and Open Source
software.  All project demos documentation and code can be found in
github, for free of course!

*** What to Expect

We will cover the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
process before any code is written, through the delivery and
mainanance of a production piece of software.
