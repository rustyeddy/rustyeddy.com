      <description>With at least a first slash at some milestones and goals that the entire team can huddle around. Let&amp;#39;s roll up our sleeves and get Buzzin!

      <description>Good Job Keeping Files Organized  Next Up Treating Your Customers with Respect (They will appreciate it!)   Please: DO NOT recruite your customers to be your QA department. Especially if they are unanaware, thinking they are getting a usable piece of software.  It is time to start adopting a Test Driven Development (TDD) mindset. Even if you are knee deep into an existing development project, get started building out our TDD now!</description>
