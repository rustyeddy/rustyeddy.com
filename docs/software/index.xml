      <title>Software is Hard</title>

      <description>Why Is Software So Difficult? Software development projects are one of the most notoriously mis-understood and incorrectly managed of all the common processes used throughout the business world.
There are a number of reasons for this chaos. Software often is solving a complex problem, that unfortunately you can&amp;rsquo;t see. But perhaps the worst problem with software projects are the diverging expectations between developers and users.
Software is Not Regulated Another reason software projects are capable of running so far amok is a lack of regulations.</description>

      <title>Customer Discovery and MVP</title>

      <description>Customer Discovery consists of one or more customer discovery sessions, where all users and owners of the software will be interviewed for their expectations, needs and desires for the upcoming software project.
User Stories The information gathered from these sessions are then articulated in a series of non-technical descriptions of how the software is used by everybody.
These descriptions of the software requirements are often referred to as User Stories. Basically, each story walks through one of the ways in which the planned software will be used.</description>

      <title>Organizing Software Projects with Kanban</title>

      <description>Kanban is fantastically simple. We will create a board with 3 columns, Todo, Work In Progress and Complete.
Each column is populated with a single card for every task that must be done. The cards are prioritized and move through the system as the work progresses.
Good Kanban Reference My goal is NOT to describe Kanban itself. Instead, here is a good video if you are not already familiar with it.</description>

      <title>Tracking Changes to Code</title>

      <description>It frightens me everytime I am introduced to a new software project where the &amp;ldquo;latest&amp;rdquo; source code is somebodies folder somewhere with copies being passed around on thumb drives.
Such a lack process invites confusion from the beginning and inspires questions like:
 which copy of the file has your changes?
 If you are working like this STOP! It does not have to be this way. no, start using Version Control now!</description>

      <title>Clone and Branch</title>

      <description>Initial changes to software are always done to a copy of the actual source code. This provides a local sandbox for the developer to make changes, experiement with fixes and and do really weird things that will never be allowed in the final product (we will cover this in the peer review section).
Clone The Repo Our actual &amp;ldquo;Source Code&amp;rdquo; resides in what&amp;rsquo;s called a Software Repository which is a server in the cloud, however the work performed by the developer is typically done on a local computer.</description>
