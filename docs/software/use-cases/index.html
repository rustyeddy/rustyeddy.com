		<h2 id="why-use-cases">Why Use-Cases?</h2>
<p>This post is going to talk about how we will use normal conversations
with the users of a software project we are about develop to lay the
foundation for the entire software development project.</p>
<p>These conversations are going to be in story form and we&rsquo;ll call them
<em>use cases</em>.</p>
<h2 id="customer-discovery">Customer Discovery</h2>
<p><em>Customer Discovery</em> consists of one or more sessions with all the
people (stakeholders) of the software (we&rsquo;ll call them users) and get
them to tell us stories about how the are going use the software.</p>
<p>Every story will be in plain, non-techy common language from the POV
of the user.  We will unravel each of the user stories into a series
of <em>use-cases</em>, much like unraveling a complex novel into a series of
short stories each with a single plot and conclusion.</p>
<p>The goal for each <em>use-case</em> is break down the various ways the system
will <em>provide value</em> to the user into a singular activities with clear
and measurable objectives.</p>
<h3 id="heres-an-example">Here&rsquo;s An Example</h3>
<p>My wife, Kelly is an active gardner, specifically she is really into
<em>succulents</em> which do well in the dry warm climate we live in costal
Southern California. Succulents, like almost every other plant need
water, however you have to be very careful NOT to over water them.</p>
<p>They tend to be on the smaller to medium size plants where Kelly has a
few hundred of these crazy looking plants all over the place making
the process of caring for them a challenge, in particular keeping
water schedules.</p>
<h4 id="automated-watering-system">Automated Watering System</h4>
<p>So I thought I&rsquo;d help her out and devise an automated water system for
her garden. This project is not just software but will also involve
prototyping and building hardware as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use-cases are not only valuable for software, but can be used while
designing hardware or system for matter, including even a business!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a hypothetical <em>Customer Discovery</em> session that
could happen in the real world. In reality I derived the use cases
from years of watching and listening to her talk about this stuff, but
you don&rsquo;t have years so I&rsquo;ll summarize it in a hypothetical conversion
that could have really happend.</p>
<h4 id="the-user-story">The User Story</h4>
<p>Here is the hypothetical summary of the automated sprinkler system
that Kelly ask me to build:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a garden of a few hundred succulents consisting of a variety
of types, succulents are very resilient but are sensitive to over
watering and each variety can have different watering needs.</p>
<p>I need an irrigation system that can automatically water my
succulents when the soil becomes too dry, yet be very careful not to
over water.</p>
<p>I need to be able to adjust the soil moisture levels for different
types of plants, because not one size fits all.</p>
<p>It will also be nice to be able to manually water by pressing a
button or even in some cases put watering on a schedule. Oh and
wouldn&rsquo;t also be cool to keep track of temprature and humidity?</p>
<p>Ya know, now that I think about it, can we also control some lights
as well? Oh, one more thing, I&rsquo;d like to observe and control my
gardens sprinklers from anywhere with my phone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how no techy talk is involved in Kelly&rsquo;s description of what
she wants out of this magic gardening system. Also notice how the pretty
simple concept of automatically watering dry plants is starting to
grow more complex with feature creep?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Use plain language in user speak
</code></pre><h2 id="user-story-to-use-cases">User Story to Use Cases</h2>
<p>OK, now we are going to break down this quasi derived conversation
into use-cases that we will then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Derive into a set of <em>testable requirements</em></li>
<li>Bust out a todo list with well defined work items</li>
<li>Begin to design the <em>User eXperience</em> with <em>wireframes</em> and
<em>storyboards</em></li>
<li>Define our <em>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</em></li>
<li>Get ready to start building</li>
</ol>
<p>The concept is simple and easy to understand, even our small example
this is a bit to unpack so let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-and-acceptance-tests">Requirements and Acceptance Tests</h2>
<p>From each of these use-cases stories we can start extracting the core requirements,
desired features and all their hopes and dreams. We will break these
stories down into <em>use cases</em>.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s get into what exactly these <em>use cases</em> are going to look
like as well as how we are going to break them down into
<em>requirements</em>, <em>tests</em> and prioritize them into specific work items.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-out-the-use-cases">Breaking out the use-cases</h3>
<p>The primary subject of the conversation is that Kelly can use help
watering her hundreds of succulents most of which are sensitive to
specific soil moisture levels.</p>
<p>The story went on to bring up other wants from the system, some
required, some nice to haves but we will break them all out
individually focusing on the most important objective first, then
working through the rest of the <em>wants</em> and <em>needs</em> until we are done.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Break out a single objective for each use case and focus on the
specific value it provides the user
</code></pre><h4 id="use-case-1-water-plants-when-the-soild-is-too-dry">Use-case 1: Water Plants when the soild is too dry</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Use-case 1: Peridoically measure the moisture level of soil and turn
on a water pump when the soil is dry, then turn it off when it gets
too wet.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="requirements-for-this-use-case">Requirements for this use-case</h5>
<p>The first use-case can now be summarized into the following three
requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Periodically measure soil moisture levels</li>
<li>If the moisture level drops below a certain level start watering</li>
<li>Turn water off when the moisture hits a high point</li>
</ol>
<p>We will find as we move on even this basic requirements are going to
be broke down into more detailed specifics as we start moving into
development.</p>
<p>The key at this point is to still keep the words and conversation in
the users terminology, as they are still a very important part of this
process.</p>
<h5 id="the-specific-value-of-this-use-case">The Specific Value of this use-case</h5>
<p>The tangible value that Kelly gets out of this use-case is not having to
manually track and water plant herself</p>
<h5 id="the-acceptance-test-for-this-use-case">The acceptance test for this use-case</h5>
<p>The <em>acceptance test</em> for this use-case will be observe a water pump
get activated when the moisture level hits the low mark, and the water
pump stop when it hits the high mark.</p>
<h5 id="the-user-experience---user-interface">The User eXperience - User Interface</h5>
<p>This use case does not actually have any user inputs or outputs other
than her knowing her plants are being watered with out have to
manually check and water herself.</p>
<p>In future use-cases we will involve a specific user interface, for
example:</p>
<ol>
<li>An ability to change the high and low moisture level configurations</li>
<li>Push a button, either physical or on an app to start or stop water</li>
<li>Look at an app or screen to see historic moisture levels and
watering times</li>
</ol>
<p>We will eventually get to these above use-cases as well, to keep this
page from growing out of control we will continue with this use-case
for the remainder of this document.</p>
<p>If you want to see all of these use-cases broken out, clink on over to
the project. <code>TODO: link to iot project</code></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-good-ol-minimum-viable-product-mvp">The Good &lsquo;ol Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h2>
<p>An important result of the customer discovery session is a mutual
agreement on what the minimum or useful (viable) piece of software is and
which can be delivered as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the MVP is to get stuff out the door. We
specifically want to avoid <em>disconnected development teams</em>.</p>
<p>Software can be properly managed just like  construction project. That&rsquo;s only if the right processes and tools are established and enforced
throughout the product lifecycle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read The <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a> to really understand how to get specific about building a product your target market will be crazy about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an involved and very important topic. I&rsquo;m not going to attempt to
repeat or summarize them in this document, but we will assume that we
have a pretty clear picture of the application we are developing, at
least enough for now.</p>
<h2 id="tasks-are-small-and-measurable">Tasks Are Small and Measurable</h2>
<p>The tasks that we come up with must be completed within a day or
two. Any task that requires three days or more should probably be
broken down into smaller bite-size tasks.</p>
<p>We do not want to create tasks so that they&rsquo;re too big, ambiguous or
subject to misinterpretation. If your team is not making progress in a
day or two you should be able to know that immediately.</p>
<p>Keeping the granularity of tasks small allows the team to <em>start
stacking victories quickly</em> and more important, gives everybody a
chance to see when a software project is about to make a left turn.</p>
<h3 id="goals-are-most-effective-when-">Goals are Most Effective When &hellip;</h3>
<p>Goals do not have to be obnoxious, obtuse, vague or
pendantic. Just be real and reasonable.</p>
<p>If you want working software, provide a working set of goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Few in number, very targeted</li>
<li>Communicated in normal people language (user stories)</li>
<li>Provide users quick and immediate value</li>
<li>Prioritized to deliver <em>usable value</em> incrementally</li>
<li>Measurable and easy to determine when they are complete</li>
<li>Everybody understands and agrees with the Goals</li>
<li>Tasks should be 1-3 days max if possible (there will always be exceptions)</li>
</ul>
<p>All these tasks have to add up to the MVP. Anything that does not
directly and immediately get the software project closer to an MVP
must be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="start-a-specific-and-measureable-goal">Start A Specific and Measureable Goal</h3>
<p>It is surprising how many software project get underway without a
clear direction to what they are building.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do NOT build a house before you have approved architectural
drawings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above statement should be self evident. The same applies to
software.</p>
<h3 id="define-good-goals">Define Good Goals</h3>
<p>Good goals keep everybody focused and working toward the same
endpoint. They must not be</p>
<ol>
<li>Singular: have a single requirement. Do not confuse the issue with
second and third level concerns</li>
<li>They are easy to understand to everybody is always on the same page</li>
<li>Goals must be measurable, you have to be able to tell when they are
done, or how well they are working.</li>
<li>Realistic: do not make people feel like the must continually be
superwoman.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A use case is the smallest unit of activity that provides a
meaningful result to the user</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First article on Use Cases was established by Swedish computer
scientist Ivar Jacobson in 1987 originally used by
telecommunications company Ericsson to capture system requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1992 Jacobson co-authored the book &ldquo;Object-Oriented Software
Engineering - A Use Case Driven Approach&rdquo; to help specifying
functional requirements in Software Development</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ivarjacobson.com/publications/articles/use-cases-ultimate-guide">Ivar Jacobson</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This document about use-cases is by the one and only Ivar Jacobson
himself. This document claims to be uses cases 2.0, an improvement on
the revolutionary process of extracting and defining requirements for
software projects.</p>
<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Defines the various ways users will use the system/software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can and should establish success and failure scenarios</p>

<p>Used to capture system requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use cases should help capture success and failure scenarios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use cases can help define functionality in an incremental aligned

</li>
<li>
<p>Use cases do not tell you HOW you should plan, schedule, test or
develop the system, but do define a structure of that can be used to
engage these practices</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="first-principals">First Principals</h3>
<p>Acording to Jacobson these are the <em>first principals</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Keep it simple by telling stories</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Story telling is the easiest and most effective way to
pass knowlege from one person to another. Story telling is older
than the Bible!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each story will tell of a single way to successfully achieve a
specific goal of the system, also how to handle problems that
will inevitably arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A single use case is a story focused on achieving a single goal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do NOT attempt to describe the entire system in one long story
rather break the system down into a series of small very short
stories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The stories must be communicated and captured in a way that makes
them actionable and testable, i.e. they can be <em>measured</em> in a
concrete way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The test cases are the most important part of the Use-case, as
they define what a successful outcome is.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the big picture</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You need to understand the big picture in order to make
prioritized decisions on what should be added and what needs to
be left out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He goes into creating use case diagrams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use cases do not have to involve people, they can involve other
automated entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use cases can involve actions from many different users. You can
have end users, system administrators and support people for
example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal is to make the collection of Use case goals accessible
to everyone. Use case diagrams can help visualize the various use
cases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on Value</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When trying to understand how a system is going to be used, it is
important to focus on the value it provides the users and other
stakeholders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal is to focus on the specific value the system will give a
specifig user, rather than long lists of functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start with the simplest possible way to achieve the goal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides an example</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use cases can have optional cases or variations on the
standard simple case</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative flows / cases do NOT have to be captured at the same
time. These can be added later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is almost always more valuable to complete and deliver the
simple easy use case first, get feedback and incrementally
deliver alternative flows later.  Rather than wait for all
features to be perfect</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build the system in slices</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Complex systems should not be attempted to build in one go,
rather they should be built in <em>slices</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each slice should be delivered providing clear incremental value
to it&rsquo;s users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The receipe is to focuse on the most useful thing the system has
to do and focus on that feature. Then take that one useful
feature and slice it into thinner slices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the test cases that will validate that particular
slice and implement the test cases followed by the slice itself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put any slices aside for questions that can not yet be answered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can make <em>estimates</em> for the time and effort required to
implement that slice but <em>estimates</em> are just that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test cases are the most important part of the use case narrative
because they make the story real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To find the <em>central</em> theme you will need to shed all the lesser
important features and focus on the most useful thing the system
does</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once enough use-cases have been implemented the user will have a
system that is useful, though still lacking features, but those
will eventually be implemented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The slice should be a complete implementation, not just the code
that fulfills the requirements but tests, user experience,
architecture, documentation, test framework, integration and
delivery (CI/CD)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A use-case is probably too much to be implemented in one
two-week period however a slice of a use-case should be able to
be implemented in one two week sprint</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deliver the system in increments</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This seems like it is repeating use-case slices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software evolves in generations vary rarely, even for the
smallest project are they developed and forever complete in one
go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software typically evolves over release after release building
on what came before it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use-cases are a great tool for release planning. Releases can be
based on a particular group of slices being implemented even
before the complete use-case itself has been developed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use-case diagrams can be useful</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adapt to meet the team&rsquo;s needs</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not all teams or software projects are the same, the system of
use-cases needs to be adaptable to the team and project needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects that have close interaction with <em>stake-holders</em> and
most specifically the users will be the most efficient and
flexible (agile)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects that lake user input due to whatever reason will need a
lot more detail in the requirements up from and be much more
heavy weight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use-case can be made extremely light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tools used can be as simple as use cases written on index
cards or more official captured in electronic tools, for example</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-are-stakeholders">What are stakeholders</h3>
<p>Everybody that has an interest in the software</p>
<ul>
<li>User that use the software on the daily</li>
<li>Administrator that has to configure and maintain the software</li>
<li>The person paying for the software</li>
<li>The developers and devops folks running and fixing the software</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-the-system">What is the System</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is typically a software system, it can be SaaS, an embedded
system with software and hardware or even a new business</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="more-about-use-cases">More about use-cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They are iterable, the first telling of a user story may not be the
final version</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fullfill the simplest story first (slice)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="priorities-slices-and-estimates">Priorities, Slices and Estimates</h3>
<p>Once all use-cases have been captured they can then be sorted
according to priorities, the highest priority use-cases can then
be have implementation estimates.</p>
