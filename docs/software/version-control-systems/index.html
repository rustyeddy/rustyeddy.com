        After all the planning time has come to change code. What happens now?  Clear evidence of a rookie team is the lack of a Version Control System (VCS) tool and associated processes built around your VCS will provide all the visibility you need to track progress of your software project. Your VCS becomes the source of truth for your project.

		<p>It frightens me everytime I am introduced to a new software project
where the &ldquo;latest&rdquo; source code is somebodies folder <em>somewhere</em> with
copies being passed around on thumb drives.</p>
<p>Such a lack process invites confusion from the beginning and inspires
questions like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>which copy of the file has your changes?</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are working like this STOP! It does not have to be this
way. no, start using Version Control now!</p>
<p>Done correctly, your VC will track <em>every change</em> to your source code
with clear well written summaries (logs) of the problem that was
solved.</p>
<h2 id="git-and-version-control">Git and Version Control</h2>
<p>Version Control Systmes (VCS) has been around since at least the
1970&rsquo;s . These included RCS, CVS, SVN and lot&rsquo;s of clunky and lame pay
versions.</p>
<p>Now we have <em>GIT</em>.</p>
<p>Git was development by the famous <em>Linus Torvalds</em> author of Linux to
handle the distributed nature of the <strong>huge</strong> Open Source software
<a href="http://kernel.org"><em>Linux Kernel</em></a>. Development and the thousands of
software developers that continuously contribute to the code base.</p>
<h3 id="github-is-git-as-a-service">Github is Git as a Service</h3>
<p>We also have Github!</p>
<p>Github revolutionized software development by taking the widely
popular <em>Git</em> version control system and wrapping online services
around them, such as an <em>Issue Tracker</em>, <em>Project Kanban Board</em> and a
whole social infrastructure allowing developers to easily share Open
Source software projects.</p>
<h2 id="github-for-services-and-workflow">Github for Services and Workflow</h2>
<p>To be clear, there are some other <em>great</em> services built around <em>git</em>,
<a href="http://gitlab.org"><em>gitlab</em></a> and <a href="http://bitbucket.org"><em>bitbucket</em></a>
are just two.</p>
<p>Fortunantely for us, <em>github</em> provides quite a few services integrated
around git itself giving us a rich set of tools to build a sophisticated
development environment, and all for <em>free</em>.</p>
<p>Github works on a <em>freemium</em> model where all Open Source projects get
all features for free. However, private repositories will be required
to pay a nominal fee to unlock all of githubs features.</p>
<p>For our purposes, everything we need is free, so don&rsquo;t pull out your
wallet!</p>
<h2 id="enough-theory">Enough Theory?</h2>
<p>OK, next we are going to roll up our sleeves and &ldquo;<em>git busy</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<hr>
<p>When a software developer or developers(s) leave a project without the
use of process or version control, it is a crap shoot as to the
quality of the code you will discover.</p>
<p>The odds are the code will be <em>crap</em>. Most people that are skilled and
care enough to write <em>clean code</em>, likewise are most likely following
some <em>process</em> or <em>best practices</em> by using version control and
documeneting the architecture.</p>
<p>The person that walks into a project own all of the bad decisions and
lies that have previously been told, the software person has nowhere
else to turn. Using Version control to establish both accountability
for decisions and trace modifications to their origin.</p>
<p>Communication should be:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>easy for everybody</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>captured to context, history for example, to capture the rationale
behind decisions that may have required a controversial
trade-off. Invaluable for repeating the same convesation.</p>
<p>Also can be used to determine when old practices can be
obsoleted. Technology has a way obliterating completely rational
decision that were made a mere two years ago..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do NOT allow project communications To be spread amongst email,
Texts, Social media accounts and various Other arbitrary Cyber
nooks and crannies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You will Lose all history and context. Debates and decisions Will be
unnecessarily repeated.</p>
<h2 id="github-and-making-the-commitment">Github and making the Commitment</h2>
<p>Now it is time for the developer to <em>commit</em> the changes she has been
working on, tested and pushed through the peer reviews. This step is
pretty simple, however, we want to make sure we are doing it
correctly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Todo example commit</p></blockquote>
<p>When the code is merged into the <strong>main</strong> or <strong>master</strong> repository,
just like commitments, it will be accompanied by the log comments
that go along with the log files.</p>
<p>Additionally, every <em>commit</em> will have a <em>unique identifier</em>, a big
nasty looking hex-i-decimal string guaranteed to most likely be locally
unique.</p>
<h3 id="history-in-the-making">History in the Making</h3>
<p>Well written comments, source diffs and a unique identifier come
together to create a specific moment in the code life history.</p>
<p>Stringing all commitments together, one forms a very accurate history
of the source development. If the comments are well written, that
history is accompanied by a wonderful narrative told by the developers
as the software is being written.</p>
<h2 id="the-beginning-of-visibility">The Beginning of Visibility</h2>
<p>This can provide the viewer with literally a line by line replay of
the entire history of a software development project. The commitments
can also be directly related to the particular <strong>github issues</strong> that
have spurred the updates to the code in the first place.</p>
<p>This is a very powerful way for not only developers, but also users,
management and marketing a deep insight into the process of software
development.</p>
<h2 id="tagging---releases">Tagging - Releases</h2>
<p>Git also provides a feature called <em>tagging</em>, which is in fact very
similar to <em>branching</em>. <em>Tags</em> however are meant to <em>label</em> a specific
reference of the source at a specific point in time.</p>
<p><em>Software releases</em> are a good reason to use <em>tags</em>. For example: a
tag <strong>v1.0.2</strong> would be a typical tag that might be used to reference
the version of code after <strong>v1.0.1</strong>.</p>
<p>This practice allows the team, or anybody interested, the ability to
<em>reference</em> and <em>re-create</em> a specific past version of the software.</p>
<h2 id="automated-builds-and-testing">Automated Builds and Testing</h2>
<p>Github provides a ton of goodies with it&rsquo;s well defined <em>API</em> and the
plethora of <em>web-hooks</em> it provides.</p>
<p>In the next section we&rsquo;ll get into <em>automatically</em> building new images
upon every committment, running the images through automated tests and
finally sending <strong>only</strong> the tested images to a file server for
general access.</p>
