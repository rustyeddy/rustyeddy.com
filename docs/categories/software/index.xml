      <description>The Red Eye project is a service definition rapper around inexpensive cameras attached to inexpesive micro-controllers that take pretty good video.
The video streams are built using the GStreamer library. The camera native capabilities are used to extract as high quailty, realtime images possible.
The video streams will be consumed by one or more sinks, including but not limited to Files, cloud storage, High Def Display and Computer Vision libraries.</description>

      <description>Skid steering basics
 Based on fixed direction wheels[1] or tracks There are two groups or sides of wheels: left and right All wheels in a group MUST always point in the same direction All wheels in a group MUST always rotate at the same rate Direction is determined by the speed of the two wheel groups  To move straight all motors rotate at the same rate Forward and Reverse are determined by positive and negative values Turning is achieved by varying the throttle on the right and left    Example The Skidder class has the following API, as you can see all of the movements we desire can be accomplished with a single API call skidder.</description>

Raspberry Pi and connected &lt;em&gt;7 inch touchscreen tablet&lt;/em&gt;.  I have it
setup in &amp;ldquo;kiosk mode&amp;rdquo;, which is basically full page chrome without the
tabs and tool bars etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
