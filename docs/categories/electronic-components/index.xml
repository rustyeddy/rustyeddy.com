      <description>Why the Adafruit version? I have had a hard time with the general Capacitive Soil Moisture sensors that you find readily on the Internet as described in this article about soil moisture sensors. In a nutshell, the ones I bought had the wrong timer chip in them, not that was a total show stopper but I also had problems getting them to work with the esp32 ADC (Analog Digical Converter).</description>

      <description>Overview Seems like I&amp;rsquo;m not as uniquely clever as I once thought, the idea of creating a self watering garden is probably one of the more popular DIY maker projects on the Internet it seems.&#xA;Check out my version of the Self Watering Garden&#xA;What makes my project different? Probably not alot, however in this project we treat each of the watering stations as a part of a larger, complete system of the watering stations that can be observed and controlled by a single hub and associated web application.</description>
