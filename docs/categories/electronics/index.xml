      <description>Pictured about is the OSEPP v2 Motor Shield which can be used as a functional replacement to the Adafruit v2 motorshield, the motorshield I recommend.
 Source code can be found here http://github.com/mobilerobot-io/arduino/ within the src/mctl directory.
 Arduino Motorsheild and Distributed Controls The software in the repository is to be loaded on an Arduino with either an Adafruit v2 Arduino or OSEPP 6612 MotorShield. The software accepts commands as incoming text strings from one of several possible serial inputs; UART, RF Radio, Blue Tooth, etc.</description>

      <title>Inexpensive Motor Controllers for Arduino and Raspberry Pi</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I prefer to use an Arduino with a Motor Controller over say a
Raspberry Pi with a motor-controller.  I believe the Arudino has
better support for dedicated Real-time software vs. the Raspberry Pi
and as a superior platform for general computing including running
Control Software.  This is how we do it on the West side &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Comparing the Arduino and Raspberry Pi</title>

      <description>Arduino vs. Raspberry Pi in Control Systems I believe the Arudino has better hardware support, a real-time clock and due to itself simplicity creates a better platform to interact with external hardware in real-time.
The Raspberry Pi, however has a much more powerful set of processors, more memory and a general purpose operating system making it a more suitable choice for general purpose, sophisticated software, such as communicaitons and control software.</description>
