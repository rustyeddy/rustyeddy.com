      <title>Real-time Dashboard</title>

      <description>Dashboard WebApp The snapshot of the dashboard above is a WebUI served by the Hub displaying the real time values for temperature, humidity and uptime. Actually three of the four stations in the screen shot above are mocked using mosquitto_pub. See the &amp;ldquo;Mocking&amp;rdquo; section of the Hub section of the website.
Recieving Data The dashboard recieves all of it&amp;rsquo;s data from the Hub which in turn streams the data to the dashboard over Websockets in real-time.</description>

      <description>Publishing Sensor Data The idea is pretty simple really: build a network of wireless battery powered devices to gather environmental data such as temprature, moisture, light levels, etc. The collected data will then be published via MQTT wirelessly to the Hub.
Types of Published Data The planned data types to be published by the system are concerned with the following types of sensors.
 Temprature Humidity Moisture Light Barometric Pressure  Technically any type of data could be published and collected however we are focused on the type of data our OG application will use.</description>

      <title>Cloud Automation</title>

      <description>Cloud Automation Cloud support extends the reach of the data globally allowing access to both real-time and historical datas, it also expands the length data can be kept. Rather than a couple weeks to a month per hub, the data loaded in the cloud can be persisted for years at very low cost.
Entire fleets of hubs can be managed from the cloud console making it easy to manage, monitor and update large deployments of not only sensor station but also the hubs.</description>

      <title>How to Build a Self Watering Garden</title>
      <link>http://www.rustyeddy.com/iot-project/</link>

      <description>What is this project about? Organic Gardner (OG) is an automated irrigation system that gathers soil moisture levels from various sections of a garden then uses that data to activate the garden sprinkler system. Done right, this will eliminate both over and under watering. Likewise there will no longer be any need to program the watering schedule with confusing sprinkler menus.
 Although she does not know it yet, my wife will volunteer her succulent garden for testing!</description>
