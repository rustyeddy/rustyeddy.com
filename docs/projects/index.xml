      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a number of exciting things about this project, building the
vehicle itself, the remote control and the streaming camera just at
the surface. The thing that excites me the most are the communications
that take place to make this all happen. See where we are at building
this project.

      <title>Moni the Web Sitter</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Moni was built to monitor resources I manage that are attached to the
web. Keeping track of servers, apps, websites and devices quickly
becomes a mess. Moni can server as an inventory database periodically
checking the health and performance of the things it manages.

      <description>The first phase of the control station that you are looking at here includes a Joystick for human control that directly moves the Camera Pan &amp;amp; Tilt assembly. The ControlStation is designed to allow the addition of wireless connectivity and an easily interchangeable set of input devices (Joystick, Gyro Displays or Computer Algorithms and so on). Output devices include motor controllers, cameras, displays and cloud storage for example.
Project Requirements Following are the high level requirements, or goals for this project.</description>

      <title>ESP32 C&#43;&#43; LED Blinker</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/esp32-blink/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/esp32-blink/</guid>
      <description>I wrote an LED C++ class to configure an ESP32 GPIO pin as a digital output, such that we can turn the LED on and off, by setting the voltage to pin HIGH, turn the LED off by setting pin to 0.
The ESP32 esp-idf development software, built on top of FreeRTOS is a rich and powerful environment that is friendly to command line hackers, but certainly C-centric. However, C++ programs are just a couple small &amp;ldquo;bookeeping items&amp;rdquo; away from full Ojbect Oriented Programming!</description>

      <description>The RedEye project was born from the need to stream video from a slowly moving robot with small inexpensive and easily available cameras.
Key Points The video streams will be consumed by a HD video display, Computer Vision control algorithms and storage.
GStreamer Framework The architecture is built around the powerful GStreamer libraries and toolset. Which means that we can immediately consume any video source that GStreamer supports.
Likewise, we can produce any video stream output that GStreamer is capable of producing.</description>
