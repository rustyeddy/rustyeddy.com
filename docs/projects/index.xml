      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a number of exciting things about this project, building the
vehicle itself, the remote control and the streaming camera just at
the surface. The thing that excites me the most are the communications
that take place to make this all happen. See where we are at building
this project.

      <title>Moni the Web Sitter</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Moni was built to monitor resources I manage that are attached to the
web. Keeping track of servers, apps, websites and devices quickly
becomes a mess. Moni can server as an inventory database periodically
checking the health and performance of the things it manages.

      <title>Redeye Computer Vision</title>

      <description>The RedEye project was born from the need to stream video from a slowly moving robot with small inexpensive and easily available cameras.
Key Points The video streams will be consumed by a HD video display, Computer Vision control algorithms and storage.
GStreamer Framework The architecture is built around the powerful GStreamer libraries and toolset. Which means that we can immediately consume any video source that GStreamer supports.
Likewise, we can produce any video stream output that GStreamer is capable of producing.</description>
