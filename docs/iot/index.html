        Building DIY electronic projects is a lot of fun. You no longer need to be a rocket scientest nor a millionaire to build some really cool IoT style of projects. Here we will build some cool projects, but unlike some other cool projects we find on websites and Youtube channels we will focus mostly on the software side of IoT development, by way of a tool called OttO that allows use to take our projects sophistication to a whole new level with communication, cloud technology and intuitive user interfaces to make our projects really cool.

		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The purpose of the project is two fold, first to build a cool IoT
project or two, second to demostrate solid <em>Software Engineering
Principals</em> and the practice of employing a professional <em><a href="../software">Software
Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</a></em>.</p>
<p>Why IoT? Aside from the fact that I really enjoy IoT and have an IoT
background. IoT employs a lot of interesting and diverse elements of
software development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IoT software projects are a combination of <em>Full Stack</em> and
<em>Embedded</em> software development.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="diversity-of-technology">Diversity of Technology</h3>
<p>We will look at some embedded software development by writting code
that runs on tiny realtime systems (esp32, raspberry Pi pico) using
<em>C++</em> and <em>python</em>, we will look at hubs and integration with a
Raspberry Pi and the <em>Go</em> programming language. Web interfaces and
Mobile Apps with <em>JavaScript</em> and <em>React</em>.</p>
<h3 id="building-extensible-systems-with-apis">Building Extensible Systems with APIs</h3>
<p>We will also be building public REST API&rsquo;s and use MQTT for a
Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) messaging system. We will also look at the
aspects of out a cloud based backend giving us access to our project
from anywhere in the world that can access the Internet.</p>
<p>From a techinical perspetive all of these items are part of IoT and
quite interesting in that they use a wide array of techical elements,
require these disparate elements to be successfully integrated
together and maintained like any complex software system.</p>
<p>Also, they require a significant co-ordinated effort among various
players: users, software developers, electrical engineers, mechanical
designs, all sorts of technitions and various other stake-holders.</p>
<p>During this process I&rsquo;ll focus on the software that I am most familiar
with and and explain sound software development practices as the
project unfolds. At the same time I&rsquo;ll be learning quite a bit about
hardware as well as improving my software skills.</p>
<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
<p>The basic Idea of this project will be to develop software to observe
and control a physical device from a remote UI, that is we will build
a little weather station that collects temperature and humidity from a
simple device and display it on a web interface viewable from
anywhere, even a phone.</p>
<p>After that we will add a relay (switch) capable of turning lights on
and off from our user interface. This basic project will lay the
foundation to build other IoT projects should we want to.</p>
<h2 id="the-architecture">The Architecture</h2>
<p>We will do this in a very open and inter-changeable manner. For
example, though we may choose say a Raspberry Pi to collect
temperature and humidity, also to control the relay we will build this
project such that it is very easy to integrate a totaly different
device using the same user interface and backend.</p>
<p>That is we&rsquo;ll create API&rsquo;s and use messaging to create a <em>loosely
coupled</em> infrastructure such that anybody that wanted to could add to
this system say an Arduino or ESP32, could do so just by developing
toward the same API&rsquo;s and messaging system.</p>

<p>Below are links to various articles that describe the project in quite
a bit more detail.</p>

              The IoT Hub is the center piece of the IoT project as gathers data, runs application logic. Provides an HTTP Server to serve up a Web App, REST API and Web sockets. This project is a Micro service written in Go, and is perfect for systems hackers, backend devs and full-stackers.

              The Collection Stations are small battery powered wireless devices outfitted with environmental sensors. They collect and publish the data to the Hub for processing. This project is built with the esp32 micro-controller, C&#43;&#43; and embedded realtime operating system.

              This is the second milestone of the Organic Gardner IoT project. The first milestones we implemented MQTT subscriptions to gather sensor data. This milestone we are going to add HTTP RESTful API to provide access to that data. The same HTTP library will later serve up our IoT dashboard.

              The primary function of an IoT Gateway is moving data from one input source (often sensor data) to another output destination (like a control algorithm) with some data conversion and storage in between. Our first milestone building the IoT Gateway is reading data from MQTT then holding it in RAM for the upcoming REST API we will build for Milestone 2.
