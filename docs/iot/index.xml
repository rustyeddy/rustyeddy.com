      <description>Previously we added MQTT to the IoT Gateway as part of the IoT Project. This gave the IoT Gateway the ability to cache environmental data in the programs RAM.
Now we want to access that data!
Geting data with REST The most popular and most appropriate style of API to provide access to the data cache is A REST API. For most people that have either written or consumed an API are familiar with REST, for those not familiar REST is a conventional way to use HTTP.</description>

      <description>This page marks the beginning of the Organic Gardner (OG) IoT Project Milestone 1 development! If you want to program along but have not yet worked with the Go programming language check this intro: Getting ready to Go.
A Brief About MQTT MQTT is the messaging protocol that a Collector will use to periodically publish sensor data (like temperature and humidity) to the IoT Gateway. MQTT will also be used to signal when the Control Station or Controller will respond to commands to turn a sprinkler pump on or off.</description>

      <title>How to Build a Self Watering Garden</title>

      <description>What is this project about? Organic Gardner (OG) is an automated irrigation system that gathers soil moisture levels from various sections of a garden then uses that data to activate the garden sprinkler system. Done right, this will eliminate both over and under watering. Likewise there will no longer be any need to program the watering schedule with confusing sprinkler menus.
 Although she does not know it yet, my wife will volunteer her succulent garden for testing!</description>
