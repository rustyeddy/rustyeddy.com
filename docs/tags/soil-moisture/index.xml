      <description>Why the Adafruit version? Because I trust them.&#xA;What is different Besides the obvious visual, It is green with a plant root, much cute-er than the other more commonly found sensors. It is also quite a bit smaller than previous sensors.&#xA;I2C and Software Technically, it also communicate via I2C which makes it more generally usable by a whole slew of other Micro-controllers which is cool but it also means we have to do a little more work reading values from the devices.</description>

      <description>Overview Seems like I&amp;rsquo;m not as uniquely clever as I once thought, the idea of creating a self watering garden is probably one of the more popular DIY maker projects on the Internet it seems.&#xA;Check out my version of the Self Watering Garden&#xA;What makes my project different? Probably not alot, however in this project we treat each of the watering stations as a part of a larger, complete system of the watering stations that can be observed and controlled by a single hub and associated web application.</description>
