      <description>SensorStation is built with an esp32 WRoom32 development board and a connected temprature sensor with on chip wifi. The software runs an event loop with a timer periodically broadcasting the local current temperature via MQTT.
 TODO: place a pic of the breadboard
 Features Thermo32 has the following features currently implemented:
 Temperature sampling with a tmp36 temperature On chip Wifi connection for Internet access MQTT client to advertise temperature to broker LED flashes to indicate temperature has been sampled and broadcast.</description>

      <description>You need to push the RESET button to get them to write flash.
A power packed chip that I have just started playing with. Give some quick specs here: and compare with other well known options (arduino&amp;rsquo;s, stm32 or Raspberry Pi.
Standout Features  Builtin Wifi &amp;amp; BT and others Dual Core Powerful esp-idf FreeRTOS (Arduino optional) Great Feature Set!  Usage Interactive Console over UART This demonstrates using the serial port for an interactive console while ESP is running other things.</description>
