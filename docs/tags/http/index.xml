      <description>Previously we have added MQTT to the IoT Gateway as part of the Organic Gardner Project. This gave the gateway the ability to collect and store a lot of environmental data from sensors all over the place.
Now we need to provide a way for others programs, like the IoT Dashboard access that data via a REST API.
Implementing a RESTful API The RESTful API convention is exteremely popular, well supported and is perfectly suited to providing access to the sensor data that has been collected.</description>
