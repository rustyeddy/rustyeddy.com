      <description>&lt;p&gt;Production software development for a Raspberry Pi is a fairly common
thing now.  This is great for many reasons, but does have the downside
that compiling large hunks of software on the PI is extremely
slow compared to a modern laptop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

or hiring,
but I have been making a living as a software engineer for the last
three decades. This is some of the lint I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered on my adventure

      <description>Every piece of software that exists has to speak to the external world in some manner. It might be programattically through messaging or an API call. It could be a human clicking through an GUI on our laptop or phone.
I think it is clear that web apps are taking over the world. It is a powerful notion that they can pretty much run on any computing devices that support a browser, which is almost everything with a screen.</description>

      <title>Designers and Developers, What is the Difference?</title>
      <link>http://rustyeddy.com/notes/website-roles/</link>

      <guid>http://rustyeddy.com/notes/website-roles/</guid>
      <description>Should I hire a web designer or web developer and what is the difference?
It is kinda funny, in the rest of the tech world the terms designer and developer mean distinctive things, and aside from a few rare unicorns, they very different roles.
Developers write code and make things work, designers make things look good. But for one reason and another, in the world of Web these skills do infact overlap to some extent, and in some rare cases a single individual is skilled at both aesthetic presentation and the practical application of abstract logic.</description>

      <guid>http://rustyeddy.com/notes/about-distributed-systems-and-micro-services/</guid>
      <description>I am very much dedicated to building distributed, micro-service style systems. I prefer to piece solutions together based on lean, efficient, best of breed components.
Besides, I work with micro-controller type of devices regularly which forces me to build out distributed system by definition.
More Complex? Many rightly claim that a distributed system increases the complexity over the monolith, and it is true that communicaiton boundaries must be explicitly created, and that communications between the boundarys becomes a potential for failure, or reduced reliability that tightly couple systems do not have to deal with.</description>

      <description>Hey I am no designer and you can accuse me of lacking originality when it comes to my design sensibilities, which can be dreadfully observed in my current version of this website (Oct 2017).
 Editorial update the above statement still holds true in early 2020.
 I love Canva it is super intuitive for a non-designer like me. It allows me to quickly create beautiful and consistent graphics for a variety of purposes including blog articles, social media properties, and such.</description>

      <description>The Unix build tool is a declarative dependency tracking build tool. Make was born in 1976, and is still how most C and C++ programs and libraries are built today, including the Linux operating system and GNU Compilers and half of all the worlds systems software.
So Many Makes, So Little Time In that time, especially during the early years of commercial fragmentation and little benefit from Open Source software, the make tool and corresponding Makefile become splintered in implementation details.</description>

      <description>The shield is driven by an SPI connection with the Arduino and relies on an SD card with music files on it to play. Must determine how to play streaming audio, then we&amp;rsquo;ll have something neat!
Link to the documentation.
The shield can also be jumpered and booted into Midi Mode and turned into a drum machine or a Garageband type of play along, this might be fun!
I suppose we could also add a microphone to record sound for some kind of reason.</description>
