      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a number of exciting things about this project, building the
vehicle itself, the remote control and the streaming camera just at
the surface. The thing that excites me the most are the communications
that take place to make this all happen. See where we are at building
this project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Website Design and Developers, What is the Difference</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/notes/website-roles/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/notes/website-roles/</guid>
      <description>Should I hire a web designer or web developer and what is the difference?
It is kinda funny, in the rest of the tech world the terms designer and developer mean distinctive things, and aside from a few rare unicorns, they very different roles.
Developers write code and make things work, designers make things look good. But for one reason and another, in the world of Web these skills do infact overlap to some extent, and in some rare cases a single individual is skilled at both aesthetic presentation and the practical application of abstract logic.</description>

      <title>Using Gstreamer to create an RTSP Server</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/notes/gstreamer-rtsp-server/</guid>
      <description>Of it earlier this month I set out to start streaming video From the CSI camera, that is a raspberry pie camera, From a moving vehicle for the vehicles guidance and navigation.
I was surprised to find the the whole world is streaming video is Incredibly complex, NFL 2019 we do not have A solution that is easy universally adopted.
TLDR; Gstreamer RTSP Pipeline We are streaming our video from a Raspberry Pi Camera (CSI) attached to, either a Raspberry Pi or a Jetson Nano, GST extracts the video from the CSI camera using a custom driver (raspicamsrc or nvargussrc) for the RPi or Nano respectively.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/redeye/</guid>
      <description>The RedEye project was born from the need to stream video from a slowly moving robot with small inexpensive and easily available cameras.
Key Points The video streams will be consumed by a HD video display, Computer Vision control algorithms and storage.
GStreamer Framework The architecture is built around the powerful GStreamer libraries and toolset. Which means that we can immediately consume any video source that GStreamer supports.
Likewise, we can produce any video stream output that GStreamer is capable of producing.</description>

      <description>WebRTC stands for Web Realtime Communications. Yea, I know you can Google too, now let&#39;s ask, &amp;ldquo;What does that mean?&amp;quot;.
Realtime Communication Generally speaking we all, intuitively know what Real Time means, it is a sense of what is happening now. OK, that is reasonable, after all it is how we live the majority of our lives.
Communication &amp;ldquo;Topologies&amp;rdquo;  One to one One to many many to many many to one?</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/notes/streaming-video/</guid>
      <description>I need to stream live video from a moving vehical with a connected camera and a possibly connected wifi.
Live High Resolution Video Video will stream from the vehicle to be picked up by video consumers and processed as required. Examples of consumers are Live Video Display on our (Webapp), OpenCV for vision algoritms.
High Demand For Low Resolution It turns out that computer vision alogrithms typically run quite a bit faster on lower resolution images, the additional information from these hi-res images can slow down the type of algorithms we are interested in by many factors.</description>

      <description>rtp rtsp rtmp hlsl mjpeg mpeg-dash mpeg jpeg  RTP ~ Real Time Protocol Actually holds payloads containing arbitrary, but time/delay sensitive media (audio, video, live conversations, etc). Incorporates enough controls to allow for network congestion, reciever compensation and more.
RTSP What it is and How to use it Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)
General consensus says that RTSP is a good choice for low latency, local area networks.</description>

      <description>The grandparents of streaming video, and snapshots, read, writing and transcoding video and single frame images are ffmpeg, vlc and gstreamer.
Other platforms, such as the wildly cool and inexpensive Raspberry Pi and attached CSI Camera (Raspberry Pi Camera) have thier own set of utilities: like raspivid. Or the NVidia Nano with it&#39;s gst-streamer plugins and nvgst-capture/nvgst-playback utilies.
 This writting is as of March 2019
 GStreamer Complex, Flexible, Future Proof GStreamer really complex pipelines but insanely flexible.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I started bumbling around trying to figure the best way to stream
[live video from a moving vehicle], I found that the Raspberry Pi
camera is capable of producing filtered versions of the images it is
producing, through &lt;em&gt;video ports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/notes/about-distributed-systems-and-micro-services/</guid>
      <description>I am very much dedicated to building distributed, micro-service style systems. I prefer to piece solutions together based on lean, efficient, best of breed components.
More Complex? Many rightly claim that a distributed system increases the complexity over the monolith, and it is true that communicaiton boundaries must be explicitly created, and that communications between the boundarys becomes a potential for failure, or reduced reliability that tightly couple systems do not have to deal with.</description>

      <description>Canva is a very simple yet powerful graphics art tool, for non-graphic artists. You can to on there and create free stuff, or, if you are a pro and create graphics all the time, you can optin for a reasonable montly fee.
I created the RedEye logo for the Mobile Robot Project using Canva, it took me 15 minutes, including remembering my forgotten password.
There are a ton of templates, graphics and photos that can be easily drag-n-dropped into place.</description>

      <description>Ansible is a very powerful yet simple, in all its complexity. It is a wonderful tool that I get frequent use of. It&#39;s real home I suppose is in the larger corporation devops world, it is wonderfully well suited to a mid sized IoT environment.
A Few Highlight about Ansible   Create Playbooks that defines the configuration of a target architecture.
  Ansible is Idempotent meaning it defines the the desired outcome, it is up to Ansible to make that outcome real.</description>

      <description>The shield is driven by an SPI connection with the Arduino and relies on an SD card with music files on it to play. Must determine how to play streaming audio, then we&#39;ll have something neat!
Link to the documentation.
The shield can also be jumpered and booted into Midi Mode and turned into a drum machine or a Garageband type of play along.</description>

      <description>Building OpenCV is quite a task, so if you are just getting started, or do not need something in more recent versions, then by all means use your OSs package management facility to install OpenCV, otherwise here is a list of things that I did to get the latest version of OpenCV built so I could infuse it with some GStreamer to deliver streaming video to our CV algorithms.
Installing on Linux and a MacOS Install cmake to build these things from scratch.</description>
