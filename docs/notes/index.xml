      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am using (&lt;em&gt;VUE&lt;/em&gt;)[&lt;a href=&#34;http://vuejs.org&#34;&gt;http://vuejs.org&lt;/a&gt;] to develop the frontend of
(&lt;em&gt;moni&lt;/em&gt;)[&lt;a href=&#34;http://rustyeddy.com/projects/moni&#34;&gt;http://rustyeddy.com/projects/moni&lt;/a&gt;] I really like Vue, though
I am not a frontend developer nor much of a JavaScript fan. Developing
with Vue makes sense to me, the Single File Component (SFC) really
fits my way of programming and thinking about code.

Realtime Communication Generally speaking we all, intuitively know what Real Time means, it is a sense of what is happening now. OK, that is reasonable, after all it is how we live the majority of our lives.
Communication &amp;ldquo;Topologies&amp;rdquo;  One to one One to many many to many many to one?</description>
