      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am using (&lt;em&gt;VUE&lt;/em&gt;)[http://vuejs.org] to develop the frontend of
(&lt;em&gt;moni&lt;/em&gt;)[http://rustyeddy.com/projects/moni] I really like Vue, though
I am not a frontend developer nor much of a JavaScript fan. Developing
with Vue makes sense to me, the Single File Component (SFC) really
fits my way of programming and thinking about code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Cross Compile for the Raspberry Pi</title>

      <description>Production software development for a Raspberry Pi is a fairly common thing now. This is great for many reasons, but does have the downside that compiling large hunks of software on an RPI is slow compared to a modern lowend laptop.
Cross Compile to Rescue To speed things up a bit we will do something the embedded world has been doing from day 1, cross compile.
That is, we are going to use our fast desktop/laptop x86 linux box to compile our program(s) for us, only it will produce a file that is capable of running remotely on the Raspberry Pi.</description>

      <title>Designers and Developers, What is the Difference?</title>

      <description>Should I hire a web designer or web developer and what is the difference?
It is kinda funny, in the rest of the tech world the terms designer and developer mean distinctive things, and aside from a few rare unicorns, they very different roles.
Developers write code and make things work, designers make things look good. But for one reason and another, in the world of Web these skills do infact overlap to some extent, and in some rare cases a single individual is skilled at both aesthetic presentation and the practical application of abstract logic.</description>
