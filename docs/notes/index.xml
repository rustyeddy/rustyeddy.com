      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am using (&lt;em&gt;VUE&lt;/em&gt;)[http://vuejs.org] to develop the frontend of
(&lt;em&gt;moni&lt;/em&gt;)[http://rustyeddy.com/projects/moni] I really like Vue, though
I am not a frontend developer nor much of a JavaScript fan. Developing
with Vue makes sense to me, the Single File Component (SFC) really
fits my way of programming and thinking about code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Designers and Developers, What is the Difference?</title>

      <description>Should I hire a web designer or web developer and what is the difference?
It is kinda funny, in the rest of the tech world the terms designer and developer mean distinctive things, and aside from a few rare unicorns, they very different roles.
Developers write code and make things work, designers make things look good. But for one reason and another, in the world of Web these skills do infact overlap to some extent, and in some rare cases a single individual is skilled at both aesthetic presentation and the practical application of abstract logic.</description>
