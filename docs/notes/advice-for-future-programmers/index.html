	  <p>I have gathered some thoughts here for people just starting out, or
thinking about becoming a programmer. I am not an expert in job search
or hiring,
but I have been making a living as a software engineer for the last
three decades. This is some of the lint I&rsquo;ve gathered on my adventure
(so far).
</p>

<h2 id="too-many-shiny-things">Too Many Shiny Things</h2>

<p>There are too many things to know. Period. Do NOT try to learn
everything. Rather determine what you want to become better at right
now. Focus on that particular skill until you can do something useful
and the key concepts have been cemented in your head.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A relatively short period of intense focus can produce skills
that can be profitably relied on for years to come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand fleeting around with every little JavaScript
framework that floats by will leave you in a permanent state of being
<em>dazed and confused</em>.</p>

<p>You can move on to something different, knowing you have a solid tool
in your growing tool belt.</p>

<h3 id="techs-come-and-techs-go">Techs Come and Techs Go</h3>

<p>Technologies come (and mostly go) at blinding rates to the point it
can very easily and thouroughly wreck a programmers <strong>true
productivity</strong>.</p>

<p>By <em>productivity</em> I mean satisfying the end users desires by placing
the <em>needs of the project</em> <strong>above</strong> <em>the needs of the technology</em>.</p>

<p>Sometimes a less elegent solution quickly and perfectly solves a
customers problem. Please, note, I am not refering to laziness that
results in mounting technical debt.</p>

<p>What I am talking about is putting away the shotgun. Sometimes the
sole of a shoe is a perfectly fine way to kill a roach.</p>

<p>To excell at programming (or anything for that matter) one must see a
project through to an efficient and usefull end product.  To be
<strong>successful</strong> it is critical to stay focused on <strong>what</strong> you are
doing and not get distracted with <strong>how</strong> you are doing it.</p>

<h2 id="learn-everywhere">Learn Everywhere</h2>

<p>Get a degree in Computer Science, go to a reputable Code Camp, take
some online courses, yes, you can learn from all of the above. I have
my prefrences, but at the end of the day&hellip;</p>

<p>The only thing that matters is you delivering the software that most
efficiently solves the customers problems, (typically) with as little
expense as possible.</p>

<h3 id="most-important-listen">Most Important, Listen &hellip;</h3>

<p>Can you deliver an application that makes your end user happy, staying
focused on them and their needs?  Where you were trained and what you
learned will become a very distant second.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Learn to listen to your client and solve their problem, you will be
a winner!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You learn something almost <em>everywhere</em>, if you pay attention.</p>

<h2 id="get-real-experience">Get Real Experience</h2>

<p>It is absolutely critical that your software get into the hands of
<em>real users</em> that provide <em>real feedback</em> of your work. You need to
take these inputs prioritize them, determine which features can
reasonably implemented, develop and deliver.</p>

<h3 id="fix-open-source-bugs">Fix Open Source Bugs</h3>

<p>There are great Open Source projects and there a zillions of bugs to
be fixed, that would make the world a better place if they are fixed.</p>

<p>Go find one, mesh with the community, fix it, submit it, go through
reviews, modify your changes, live through a commit to master.</p>

<p>You will have done several things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Made the world a better place</li>
<li>Learned a lot of very valuable supporting tech skills</li>
<li>Learned to deal with people to accomplish a common goal</li>
<li>Grew thick enough skin to deal with an asshole or two</li>
<li>You have some gold stars to hang by your name.</li>
</ol>

<p>And more important than all of that, you most likely impressed some
powerful and influencial hackers that could quite possibly lead to an
exciting and florishing career!</p>

<h2 id="do-not-ask-stupid-questions">Do NOT ask Stupid Questions</h2>

<p>There are stupid questions. A stupid question is one that can be
answered by Google in less than two minutes.</p>
