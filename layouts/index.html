		    <p>
			I started developing an IoT application as a
			public portfolio project. I am doing this because I am
			a <i>programmer for hire</i> and good portfolio pieces
			are critical to getting good gigs.
			After all, who doesn't want to know the programmer they are
			hiring is a good programmer? That is totally reasonable, I
			get it.
		    </p>

		    <p>
			So, I <i>obviously</i> need a portfolio! Or
			atleast one signature, flagship overature show
			piece! Heck, I can do that. As matter of fact,
			I have always wanted to.  It may as well be a
			good one.  The only problem is the majority of
			my outstanding work was paid for and not Open
			Source. So I will need to come up with something
			new, or at leasta kinda newish.</p>

		    <p>
			OK, it's gotta be <i>interesting</i> and built with <i>modern tech.</i>
			Most important, this process I am going to document and improve upon
			a set of what I consider "software best practices", which means DevOps
			from cradle to grave!
