		    <p>
			I am developing an <i>interesting IoT</i>
			application. The application will be designed with modern
			technology and solve an interesting and useful
			problem. The application is all Open Source, so I would love to
			have you follow along and even chip in if you like.
		    </p>

		    <h3 class="text-center m-4">IoT, Devops, Front
			Ends Backends ~ we got it all!</h3>

		    <p>
			On this project we are going to focus equally
			on a modern, agile <i>Software Development Life
			Cycle (SDLC)</i>, a modern <i>tech stack</i> and
			<i>DevOps</i> practices.
