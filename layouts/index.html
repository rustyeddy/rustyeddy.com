		    <p>
			I started developing an IoT application as a
			public portfolio project. I am doing this because I am
			a <i>programmer for hire</i> and good portfolio pieces
			are critical to getting good gigs.
			After all, who doesn't want to know the programmer they are
			hiring is a good programmer? That is totally reasonable, I
			get it.
		    </p>

		    <p>
			So, I <i>obviously</i> need a portfolio! Or
			atleast one signature, flagship overature show
			piece! Heck, I can do that. As matter of fact,
			I have always wanted to.  It may as well be a
			good one.  The only problem is the majority of
			my outstanding work was paid for and not Open
			Source. So I will need to come up with something
			new, or at leasta kinda newish.</p>

		    <p>
			OK, it's gotta be <i>interesting</i>, <i>modern tech</i> and
			some with an eye toward improving the <i>Software Development
			Life Cycle (SDLC)</i>, that is software from
			cradle to grave.  Since I do not have all the
			skills for this project, I will use all
			OpenSource so I expect to find support from
			the greater Open Source community!</p>

		    <p>
			At least this is the plan, I am hoping to get help from YOU. If you
			are responsible for building software or would like to build a web
			application for your business, I would love to hear about your
			problems, challenges, questions and advice.
