	    <p>
		I was born a normalish kid from <em>Wilmington
		Ca. 92648</em>, I started surfing when I was approximately
		9 years old.  The fact that you can never predict, nor
		schedule when the surf will be good, it dictated that I
		create a lifestyle that allowed the flexibility to surf
		when the wave got good.  So I became a software
		engineer.

	    <p>
		This website is a <em>static</em>_ website written
		primarily with markdown, using Hugo as the static site
		generator.  I have included a little bit of Vue.js and
		JavaScript in general to sexy things up a bit.

	    <p>
		You can expect to find some of my  recent projects on
		this website, along with the software development
		processes and proceedures that I have collected, and
		adapted over the years.
