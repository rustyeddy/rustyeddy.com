    I started this website for a couple reasons, first of all, to talk
    about myself.  You see, I am a Software Contractor and this website 
    needs to efficiently let people know about me, access my resume,
    portfolio and such.

    The other, more exciting reason I have this website is to
    acculmulate the appropriate lean set of processes that benefit a
    small team developing a website / app.
