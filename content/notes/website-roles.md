Should I hire a _web designer_ or _web developer_ and what is the difference?

It is kinda funny, in the rest of the tech world the terms _designer_
and _developer_ mean distinctive things, and aside from a few rare
unicorns, they very different roles.

_Developers_ write code and make things work, designers make things
look good. But for one reason and another, in the world of Web these
skills do infact overlap to some extent, and in some rare cases a
single individual is skilled at both aesthetic presentation and the
practical application of abstract logic.

But for most of us involved in the Web world, no matter how well
trenched we are in one or the other, we inevitebly end up _crossing
over_ and having to produce the skills of the other.

As for me (thanks for asking!) I am a developer, a pretty good one. I
have my entire life assumed the I was NOT a good designer and in fact
do not really posses any artistics skills at all[1], but I am of a
more logical and mathematical mind (at least I thought).

But, I have also found the ALL of the best _applications_, _websites_
and overall _user experiences_ in computing and web require greatness
in development and design.

I would go a bit further and say that thought into the whole User
Experience to be a key.

1: I no longer believe this, I do infact have some artistics skills,
but lets just say beautiful design absolutely does not come natureally
or easy for me, but I can do it to a satisfactory (not amazing level!)
