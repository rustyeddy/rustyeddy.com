  Two of the biggest red flags in a software project is a lack of
  history or accountability. 
---

When a software developer or developers(s) leave a project without the
use of process or version control, it is a crap shoot as to the
quality of the code you will discover.

The odds are the code will be _crap_. Most people that are skilled and
care enough to write _clean code_, likewise are most likely following
some _process_ or _best practices_ by using version control and
documeneting the architecture.

The person that walks into a project own all of the bad decisions and
lies that have previously been told, the software person has nowhere
else to turn. Using Version control to establish both accountability
for decisions and trace modifications to their origin.
    
Communication should be:

1. easy for everybody
2. captured to context, history for example, to capture the rationale
   behind decisions that may have required a controversial
   trade-off. Invaluable for repeating the same convesation. 

   Also can be used to determine when old practices can be
   obsoleted. Technology has a way obliterating completely rational
   decision that were made a mere two years ago..

3. Do NOT allow project communications To be spread amongst email,
   Texts, Social media accounts and various Other arbitrary Cyber
   nooks and crannies.

You will Lose all history and context. Debates and decisions Will be
unnecessarily repeated.
