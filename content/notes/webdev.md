This section of my website is a collection of _processes_ and _best
practices_ regarding software development. I gather them here, in an
attempt to remember and formalize.


Over the years, I have collected a set of practices and certain software
practices and patterns. When I work for a client these practices will
be documented as part of the development process.

This section of my website is dedicated to the development of web
sites and apps.  It will hopefully be as fluid as necessary.
