The shield is driven by an SPI connection with the Arduino and relies
on an SD card with music files on it to play.  Must determine how to
play streaming audio, then we'll have something neat!

Link to the [documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-music-maker-shield-vs1053-mp3-wav-wave-ogg-vorbis-player/assembly). 

The shield can also be jumpered and booted into Midi Mode and turned
into a drum machine or a Garageband type of play along, this might be
fun!

I suppose we could also add a microphone to record sound for some kind
of reason.?.
