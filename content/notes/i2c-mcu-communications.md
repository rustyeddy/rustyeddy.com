  Sometimes a single micro-controller is not enough, and the ubiquitous I2C
  is built right into the Arduino, Raspberry Pi and lots of other chips, lets
  see what it takes to use it for inter-MCU communications.

I wanted to use an Arduino AND a smarter device, but did not want to waste the power, 
overhead and money to purchase an arduino ethernet shield.  Rather we can use
the I2C bus just fine, thank you very much!
