Thankfully the Internet has some kind soles that also happen to be
incredible designers and they have taken the time and energy to
communicate their design best practices with us. So I am taking a tiny
bit of time to write a short brief on the design process I have
acquired from various sources over the years, it looks something like
this:

## Scribble Out Ideas

Brain Storm, Brain Dump, whatever. Get something down, for me paper is
necessary. Draw tools on computers slow me down alot. If you are
proficient with graphic design tools, God bless you, I envy you!

For me colored pens and a moleskine are my tools of choice.

1. Scribble out ideas, brain storm, brain dump
2. Wireframe every page (paper or online is fine), I like paper. Maybe
   because I am part caveman.

### Wireframes

Paper for me. In the beginnings wireframes do not have a ton of
detail. You can also leave out the copy by replacing text with
appropriately weighted and sized squiggly lines.

> Todo: Take a shot of one my wireframes and place here, that'd be
> cool, right?

1. Wireframe every unique page or template
   1. One wireframe per reusable template is fine!
2. Give every section of every page an identity
   1. We will use it to track our media inventory

At the end of the day we are going to either want or be required to
produce a User Interface that is "flawless" to some reasonable extent,
to do this, every piece of every page needs to sport a design that
consistent with the rest of the site. 

We may as well do the best we can thinking the site, pages and purpose
of every page.

### Style Guide

1. Font Families for Header and Body
2. Fix font sizes and styles for all elements
3. Figure out spacing, white space is good

1. Color Palate, including all shades

1. Color Use Guidelines
   1. White text on images always

3. Create a Manifest for all Required content
   1. Inventory content: location if ready, assigned todo if it needs
      to be created ready.
