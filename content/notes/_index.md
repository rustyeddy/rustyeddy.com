title: My Field Notes
description: >
  I take notes from time to time and I like to use the Internet to
  store them because it is easy to find them this way (sometimes).

Here are a few notes that I have jotted along the way.  I am currently
spending a good hunk of my time working on the [Mobile Robot
Project](http://mobilerobot.io), my
[Resume can be found here](http://rustyeddy.com/resume), [and a much
neglected portfolio here](http://rustyeddy.com/portfolio).  I hope you
find something here that is helpful, if so drop me a line! 

## Road Map

- Start with a specific measureable goal and build from that
  - Every addition or new feature serves a specific purpose
  - The new feature does not disrupt previous use
- Story board and Wireframe
  - Identify use cases
  - Walk through use cases with story boards
  - Wireframe every step of the story
  - Every frame of the story requires content
	- written
	- video
	- images
	- other: pdf, etc
  - Every story has a specific measurable conclusion
- Style Guide
  - Getting some help from friends
	- Rafal Tomal
	- Refactoring UI
	- Nathan ...
  - From Wireframes to Layouts
	- Designer to Developer (lets loose labels and embrace strengths
      and weaknesses)
  - Color Pallete
  - Typography
  - Template from Layouts
- Development Host
  - Never develop in the wild
	- Risk of disaster increases astronomically
	- "Fixes" get out of sync, all fixes must funnel through a well
      defined process.
	- Using devhost
- ALWAYS use protection, we have a VCS!
  - Version control, we'll use github
  - Everything is easy to find, but YOU must follow the rules
  - Everything can be automated to ensure quality!
  - Everyhinng can be REMEMBERED!!
- Keeping it Simple
  - Static sites generated from hugo (you can use jekyll, or..)
  - Just need simple hosting (no databases, etc.) github pages will do
    just fine, thank you
- Tracking Bugs and Requesting Features
  - Issue tracking and github issues
  - Github projects (alternatives) and kanban board
  - issues, to commits, to test runs to release, to closing.
- Production Hosting
  - CI/CD release process: hugo to github pages
  - add build step
  - discuss other "static" hosting alternatives
  - discuss other hosting options that includes databases
  - mention other sophisticated backed ends
- DevOps
  - CI CD process from fix the production
  - Monitoring and responding to problems
  - Problem tracking to testbed
	- turn production bugs into futur tests
  - collecting lots of data, what to do?


That's, there is nothing left todo! Time to kick back and chill out.
That is, unless you want to do something with all this work, like
market it to real **paying** users!  Or build out a GraphQL backend
with MQTT to support your fantastic _Single Page App_..

Then, there's plenty more work to do, but let's kick it for a bit.
