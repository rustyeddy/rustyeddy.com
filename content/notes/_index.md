title: My Field Notes
description: >
  I take notes from time to time and I like to use the Internet to
  store them because it is easy to find them this way (sometimes).

Here are a few notes that I have jotted along the way.  I am currently
spending a good hunk of my time working on the [Mobile Robot
Project](http://mobilerobot.io), my
[Resume can be found here](http://rustyeddy.com/resume), [and a much
neglected portfolio here](http://rustyeddy.com/portfolio).  I hope you
find something here that is helpful, if so drop me a line!
