As it turns out building a Robot is complicated, one of the many
challenges of building a _working_ robot is achieving a satisfactory
level of many full time disciplines, including but not limited to:
mechanics and materials, electronics and power, software and
communication, these are just high level disciplines, each of these
categories involves many specialties.

## Here are Some Interesting and Active Projects

The list that follows represents the _active mobile robot_ projects.
There are a lot of ways to follow along or get involved.  Interested
in electronics and power?  Want to develop better steering mechanics,
interested in software communications, vision processing or machine
learning? 

### Follow or Get Involved

The Mobile Robot Project is really a gathering of some very
interesting and moderately complex sub-projects.  I certainly can't do
this all myself, so I strongly encourage you to get involved!

Even if that does mean, just giving some advice from the trenches!
