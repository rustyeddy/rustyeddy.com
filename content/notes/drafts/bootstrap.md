Bootstrap is a great way to get your ugly little fledgling website
into something respectable in no time. Do not waste time futzing with
silly formating directives, focuse on the site itself!

Bootstrap is used as the basis for styling this website, and most everthing I
am responsible for designing, primarily because it looks great (professional),
it is easy to use and customize and I understand it pretty well.

> That means I get fairly good looking and professional pages with little
> effort. Not original, but that is not my goal.
