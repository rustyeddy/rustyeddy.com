  There is no reason to have ugly graphics, or a cheap looking logo
  for anything you are serious about. Canva makes it sinful to accept
  ugly graphics.

Hey I am no designer and you can accuse me of lacking originality when
it comes to my design sensibilities, which can be dreadfully observed
in my current version of this website (Oct 2017).

I love [Canva](http://canva.com) it is super intuitive for a
non-designer like me.  It allows me to quickly create beautiful and
consistent graphics for a variety of purposes including blog articles,
social media properties, and such.

In my case, I use Canva to create some blog images to stir emotion and
interest, while occaisionally passing along something informative.  At
times I'll even use Canva to create images used in production
software.

For me, The key to keeping Canva, or any design project I find myself
spearheading, an ultimate success is closely following the direction
of smart and talented designers, while nozzling my own creative juices
from splattering all over an other wise brilliant piece of work.

When it comes to design projects, I try to stay out of my own
way.. Let the designers shine! In this case it is the huge 

That's it, _beautiful image_! Move on.!.

Some examples of images I created on Canva are "logos" for a couple of
my personal projects:

- TODO: control-station logo
- TODO: redeye logo
- TODO: SPAClock Logo

I created the RedEye logo for the Mobile Robot Project using Canva, it
took me 15 minutes, including remembering my forgotten password.

Canva provides a ton of templates, graphics and photos that can easily
be dropped into place.
