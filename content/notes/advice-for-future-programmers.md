I have gathered some thoughts here for people just starting out, or
thinking about becoming a programmer. I am no expert in this matter,
but I have ben making a living as a software engineer (or similar
term) for the last three decades, this is some of the lint I've
gathered on the journey.

## Too Many Shiny Things

There are too many things to know. Period. So do NOT try to learn
everything, rather determine the _right_ set of things to become
really good at, and learn how to figure the otherstuff out as you need
to. 

### Techs Come and Techs Go

Technologies come (and sometimes go) at blinding rates to the point it
can very easily and thouroughly wreck a programmers **true
productivity** toward occomplishing something useful. 

To excell at programming (or anything for that matter) one must see a
project through to an efficient and usefull end product.  To do this,
it is critical to stay focused on **what** you are trying to get the
application to do, NOT on **how** you can or can not do it.

## Learn Everywhere

Get a degree in Computer Science, go to a reputable Code Camp, take
some online sources, yes, you can learn from all of the above. I have
my prefrences, but at the end of the day:

Can you deliver an application that makes your user happy. Stay
focused on them, where you learned to do things and how you learned to
do them are all secondary to:

> Learn to listen to your client and solve there problem, you will be
> a winner!

## Get Real Experience

It is absolutely critical that your software get into the hands of
_real users_ that provide _real feedback_ of your work. You need to
take these inputs prioritize them, determine which features can
reasonably implemented, develop and deliver.

### Fix Open Source Bugs

There are great Open Source projects and there a zillions of bugs to
be fixed, that would make the world a better place if they are fixed.

Go find one, mesh with the community, fix it, submit it, go through
reviews, modify your changes, live through a commit to master.

You will have done several things:

1. Made the world a better place
2. Learned a lot of very valuable supporting tech skills
3. Learned to deal with people to accomplish a common goal
4. Grew thick enough skin to deal with an asshole or two
5. You have some gold stars to hang by your name.

And more important than all of that, you most likely impressed some
powerful and influencial hackers that could quite possibly lead to an
exciting and florishing career!

## Do NOT ask Stupid Questions

There are stupid questions. A stupid question is one that can be
answered by Google in less than two minutes.
