I have gathered some thoughts here for people just starting out, or
thinking about becoming a programmer. I am no expert in this matter,
but I have ben making a living as a software engineer (or similar
term) for the last three decades, this is some of the lint I've
gathered on the journey.

I am certainly no authority on this matter, and my opinion and view
may (probably will) differ than mainstream wisdow, so take the
following "advice" with grains of salt!

## Too Many Fish and Technologies

Technologies come (and sometimes go) at blinding rates to the point it
can very easily and thouroughly wreck a programmers **true
productivity** toward occomplishing something useful. 

To excell at programming (or anything for that matter) one must see a
project through to helpful ness. 

> Get Experience and Feedback from real users!

It is absolutely critical that your software get into the hands of
_real users_ that provide _real feedback_ of your work. You need to
take these inputs prioritize them, determine which features can
reasonably implemented, develop and deliver.

You are successful when your program meets or exceeds **your users**
primary needs
