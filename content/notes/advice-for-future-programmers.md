  Here is my advice to you if you are beginning to program, or
  thinking about starting and want to do it for money.

I have gathered some thoughts here for people just starting out, or
thinking about becoming a programmer. I am not an expert in job search
or hiring,
but I have been making a living as a software engineer for the last
three decades. This is some of the lint I've gathered on my adventure
(so far).

## Too Many Shiny Things

There are too many things to know. Period. Do NOT try to learn
everything. Rather determine what you want to become better at right
now. Focus on that particular skill until you can do something useful
and the key concepts have been cemented in your head.

> A relatively short period of intense focus can produce skills
> that can be profitably relied on for years to come.

On the other hand fleeting around with every little JavaScript
framework that floats by will leave you in a permanent state of being
_dazed and confused_. 

You can move on to something different, knowing you have a solid tool
in your growing tool belt.

### Techs Come and Techs Go

Technologies come (and mostly go) at blinding rates to the point it
can very easily and thouroughly wreck a programmers **true
productivity**. 

By _productivity_ I mean satisfying the end users desires by placing
the _needs of the project_ **above** _the needs of the technology_. 

Sometimes a less elegent solution quickly and perfectly solves a
customers problem. Please, note, I am not refering to laziness that
results in mounting technical debt. 

What I am talking about is putting away the shotgun. Sometimes the
sole of a shoe is a perfectly fine way to kill a roach.

To excell at programming (or anything for that matter) one must see a
project through to an efficient and usefull end product.  To be
**successful** it is critical to stay focused on **what** you are
doing and not get distracted with **how** you are doing it.

## Learn Everywhere

Get a degree in Computer Science, go to a reputable Code Camp. Take
some online courses, yes, you can learn from all of the above. I have
my prefrences, but at the end of the day...

The only thing that matters is you delivering the software that most
efficiently solves the customers problems, (typically) with as little
expense as possible.

### Most Important, Listen ...

Can you deliver an application that makes your end user happy, staying
focused on them and their needs?  Where you were trained and what you
learned will become a very distant second.

> Learn to listen to your client and solve their problem, you will be
> a winner!

You learn something almost _everywhere_, if you pay attention.

### Fix Open Source Bugs

One of the best things you can do to get your career started (or
rejuvinated) is working on real problems with modern technology.
There is no better place than a good Open Source project to get that
experience.

Go find a good one, mesh with the community, fix some bugs
and get humbled a few times:

You will have done several things:

1. Made the world a better place
2. Learned a lot of very valuable supporting tech skills
3. Learned to deal with people to accomplish a common goal
4. Grew thick enough skin to deal with an asshole or two
5. Hang some gold stars by your name.

More important than all of that, you most likely impressed some
powerful and influencial hackers that could quite possibly lead to an
exciting and florishing career!

## Do NOT ask Stupid Questions

There are stupid questions. A stupid question is one that can be
answered by Google in less than two minutes.
