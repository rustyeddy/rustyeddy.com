title: The NRF240L1 RF Transceiver 
description: >
  This is a popular and powerful little RF chip that can be easily
  integrated into most any embedded application (even low power) by
  creating point to point pipelines or full mesh networks.  Lets get
  down and crazy with some RF!

This RC reciever chip is very easy to use out of the box, yet provides
some very sophisticated capabilities.  The first project We'll start
using this chip will be a remote control Joystick for our mobile
robot.

## Todos:

- point to the datasheet
- load personal photos of my project with NRF20L
  - pull the image from evernote
- fritz a diagram 
- post code that I use and or wrote
- Try to do an eagle cad

## Source Voltage

According to [Benjamin David
Fraser](https://medium.com/@benjamindavidfraser/arduino-nrf24l01-communications-947e1acb33fb)
Plugging the NRF24L02 directly into the Arduino 3.3v power supply pin,
will produce unregulated power, which will eventually lead to flaky or
failed communications.

He suggests either buying a voltage regulator to ensure we get a
smooth regulated 3.3v.  

Or you could stick a 1-10 uF Capacitor between the Vcc and Ground
terminals, that minimally should regulated the 5v step down to a
regulated 3.3v.

## SPI Interface

The NRF24L01 operates from the SPI Interface, so controlling the chip
with the standard pin outs on the Arduino or Raspberry Pi will be
adequate for controlling the chip.

## Point To Point Send and Recieve

## Mesh Networks

## Support on Arduino

We have it connected and communicating between two ends of an
Arduino.  On one end we have the [joystick](/projects/joystick)

## Suipport on Raspberry Pi
