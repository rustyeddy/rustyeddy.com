  This document I briefly describe the primary elements of my software
  development process, if more details are required, then perhaps I
  will find to the time to expand.

This guide is best suited for small to mid sized development projects,
a good example are micro-services or embedded development for small
manufactures, makers and IoT companies.

## Planning 

0. Describe the purpose of the project, it's primary use case
1. Determine a Primary Measurable Goal
   2. Primary goals may be supported by multiple sub-goals

### Milestones and Desired Outcomes

We would like to break a project out into specific _measureable_
deliverables, matched against specific dates. These will be called
_milestones_, will likely represent major releases of software. 

If you focus less on specific technologies and principals of sound
Software Engineering and Design, it you will care much less about
languages and technologies because you will see them as tools (not an
end product).

## Pick Something Practical and Useful

Experimenting with crazy projects is encouraged! They are fun, they
expand our abilities, they may even give us a core component to
something completely unrelated!

However, our main focus, always should be building something used by
others, that is far and away the mean application to work on first.
Spend some time creating a _utility_.

Pick your technologies: Go-Wasm for example and start working on it,
learning the things you need as you go, this can help you tremendously
when it comes to _staying focused_ and you will learn a ton actually
getting thing working, makeing people happy, fixing bugs and
deploying.
