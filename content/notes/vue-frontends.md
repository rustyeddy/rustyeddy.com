I am using (_VUE_)[http://vuejs.org] to develop the frontend of
(_moni_)[http://rustyeddy.com/projects/moni] I really like Vue, though
I am not a frontend developer nor much of a JavaScript fan. Developing
with Vue makes sense to me, the Single File Component (SFC) really
fits my way of programming and thinking about code.

I like it!
