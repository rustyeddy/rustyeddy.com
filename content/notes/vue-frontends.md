  VueJS is a JavaScript framework that has become immensly popular in
  recent years for good reason in my humble opinion.  I am specifically
  interested in using vue to develop kiosk style dashboards.

  - place links to vue resources

Every piece of software that exists has to speak to the external world
in some manner. It might be programattically through messaging or an
API call. It could be a human clicking through an GUI on our laptop or
phone.

I think it is clear that _web apps_ are taking over the world. It is a
powerful notion that they can pretty much run on any computing devices
that support a _browser_, which is almost everything with a screen.

That means that projects in the IoT space that need some form of human
GUI can benefit from one of the largest develop echo systems in
existance, web development.

## Learning Java Script

I am not much of a _Front End_ developer. I do know HTML and CSS, SCSS
fairly well, though my joy and enthusiasm dicking with layouts and css
nuances quickly runs thin..

But I do realize, and appreciate the value of a well done User
Interface leading to an excellent User eXperience! The type of work I
do needs to communicate complex thought in real time, sometimes with
sifting through lots of data.

So I want to become comfortable with a powerful, flexible and
well known way to develop IoT dashboards. 

### Go with the VUE

Of all the JavaScript frame works [_VUE_](http://vuejs.org) just seems
to be the best fit for what I'm trying to do. I plan to use the
[_SPAClock_](http://rustyeddy.com/projects/spaclock) project to create
a great VUE interface.

## CDN and Training Wheels

I just include the CDN link to the vue.js package and have coded some
very simple UI tasks. 

My real goal here is to start using the _Single Page Components_ and
being able to take advantage of reusable interface packages. 

I am not looking forward to getting lost in the JavaScript package
manager hell...

### What Have I Done?

So far not much more than the intro tutorials, I need to make another
pass at giving the front end of the SPAClock a great VUE!

My main question now is:

> Do I need to use vue-cli or straight to some build set? Can I stick
> to the CDN?

I do not know the answer to this question yet. If you would like me to
find the answer, just ask, I will!!!  Even better, if you can answer
this question, please do!

Chow Dog!
