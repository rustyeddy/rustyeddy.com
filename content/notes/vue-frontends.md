  VueJS is a JavaScript framework that has become immensly popular in
  recent years for good reason in my humblest of opinions.  Check it
  out, what do you think?

Every piece of software that gets used has to speak to the external
world somehow. Some might be programattically through messaging or
REST, it may be a human with a GUI based desktop or perhaps a Web app.

Well, I think it is clear that _web apps_ are taking over the world. I
am also like the fact that web applications can pretty much run on
anything (not just a windows machine, or IOS phone), but _anything_
with a browser.

- web apps run on anything
- web apps run from anywhere
- web apps are not dependent on server or browser

So that means that almost all of my projects, which are basically IoT
type of projects will need some form of human GUI, therefore I figure
the smartest thing I could do is:

> learn to develop a modern web app, then my stuff will run
> everywhere! 

## Webapp Run from Anywhere

I am using [_VUE_](http://vuejs.org) to develop the frontend of
[_SPAClock_](http://rustyeddy.com/projects/spaclock). I am not a
JavaScript developer and I am only modestly familiar with JavaScript
and it's endless myriad of build tools and things.

I've browsed about and listned to lots of the Angular, React, Ember,
Vue just seems fit a bit better without demanding a wrecking ball
approach to development.

## I am using training wheels

I just inlclude the CDN links and have started using VUE for fairly
simple UI tasks. 

My real goal here is to start using the SinglePageCompenents, I am
particularly interested in the html style templates, rather than try
to edit them as strings (DOUBLE CAPITAL YUUUUUUKK!).

### What Have I Done?

Todo: make a list of what I have accomplished with vue so far... 

My main question now is

> Do I need to use vue-cli or straight to some build set? Can I stick
> to the CDM?

I do not know the answer to this question yet. If you would like me to
find the answer, just ask, I will!!!

Chow Dog!
