  The chassis makes up the body of the vehicle, steering system and
  the drive train that moves the car, pretty much all mechanical. We
  started with a kit but quickly outgrew it.

I quickly outgrew my first introductory robotics kit. I started with
my first Robotic Kit (actually 4 of them), I choose the kits that
provided the chassis only, after all, I did not know if I would want
to base it on a Raspberry Pi or Arduino (or both), perhaps something else
entirely?  Follow the story and find out what happened:

## Intro Robotic Kits
### All inclusive
### Bring Your own Electronics
### Open Source Software

## Choosing Your Controller(s)
### Raspberry Pi ~ Pros and Cons
### Arduino ~ Pros and Cons
### Motorsheilds
### Others

## Were Rubber Meets the Road
### 2, 4 or 6 wheels
### Track Systems
#### Wheels in Track System

### Number of Motors
#### 1, 2, 4 or 6 wheel drive?

## Steering
### Skid Steering
### Cart Steering 
### Rack and Pinion
### Ackerman

Introductory Robotic kits come in a dizzing array of choices, some
kits are all inclusive, they have a chassis and either wheels or
tracks for most mobile robots.

Some include electronics, typically a Raspberry Pi or Arduino (Arduino
Mega), some include all the sensors you need and software.  Others
supply only parts of what you need.



I started buying a kit, a mechanical 
	
Though I started with a mechanical kit (actually 4) and supplied my
own electronics, a Raspberry Pi + an AdaFruit Motorshield.

We have grown beyond the intro level kit cars, kinda of.  That is, I
want to start adding more hardware and smarter software to the kits,
however the size of the hardware becomes a challenge, not only Adding
hardware We also need to support larger heavier power supplies, As well
as significantly more complex wiring. 

This can be tricky to dial in a nice tight design for production, That
is not necessarily the best design to go with during eight testing
phase or proof of concept, Which is what we are doing.

Our Our main priority is a system that can be easilyTestedModularDad
we don't have to reinvent and start from scratchAnd also a physical
space it's big enough toTinker with the hardware until we really
dial-inWell we are going to do. 


## Getting Started with a Kit

There are hundreds of really good kits to get started with the
robotics available for purchase online, Which is exactly how I started
kind of. 

### All Inclusive vs. BYE

It's easy to find at least two types of kits, All-inclusive kits Will
include the mechanical vehicle or robot They will also provide the
microcontroller and various sensors. 

A good example of this would be the Zumo robot by
Paulo(spelling?).  The better kids will includeWell-designed
hardwareAs well asGood software and good documentation. It is easy to
find kids that do a good jobOne or two of the above reported jobs of
the other Which you can create challenges. 

But That Zumo robot seem to do a good jobOf all of the above.

### Bring Your Electronics

I went with a kit (actually 4) that provided the _mechanical robot_
but no electronics.  After all I did not know if I wanted to use an
[Arduino](http://arduino.org) or a [Raspberry
Pi](http://raspberrypi.org), Or perhaps something else? 

My first purchase was the OSEPP all set Tank, And just for the heck of
it I bothered to Will balancing robot as well.  These kids come
asErector set style Metal beans with nuts and bolts that hold them
together.

While I love this idea, I found during the early experimental stagesOf
building a more advanced robot, That I would need something that
providedA lot of room and tolerant experimentation. 

## Robotic Styles and Construction

I felt that constructing a robot with metal beams would be much more
efficient for specific applications thar have been better thought
through. 

I found the beem construction can become unstable, bolts loosing
during crashes and things.

### Robot Prototyping

I found I needed something that was a lot more friendly to
prototyping.  Tolerant of making mistakes And it induces to creating
modular Blocks to build a robot with.

You can call this a framework of sorts, HoweverThe idea is not to
createA big piece of software that constitutes the framework, Rather
SNF documentations, Proof of concepts And perhaps libraries Of
software Dark and deuces to experimentation and reuse.

### Out Growing Intro Kits

For me, it was easy to outgrow the intro kit
