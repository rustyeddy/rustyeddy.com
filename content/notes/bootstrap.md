Every Web UI needs A little bit of styling to make a page or website
not only readable, but be useable with out making your user throwup.
Bootstrap is a great way to quickly get started building some nice and
orderly looking web pages. A little more about Bootstrap now.

Bootstrap is used as the basis for styling this website, and most everthing I
am responsible for designing, primarily because it looks great (professional),
it is easy to use and customize and I understand it pretty well.

> That means I get fairly good looking and professional pages with little
> effort. Not original, but that is not my goal.
