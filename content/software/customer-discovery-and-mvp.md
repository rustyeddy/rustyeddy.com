title: Customer Discovery and MVP
description: >
  Customer Discovery is used to dig deep into the customer or the user
  of the software. This is a significant and important topic that will
  set your project on a trajectory of either success or failure. Make
  sure you get started right.

_Customer Discovery_ consists of one or more customer discovery
sessions, where all *users* and *owners* of the software will be
interviewed for their expectations, needs and desires from the
upcoming software project. 

## User Stories

The information gathered from these sessions are then articulated in a
series of _non-technical_ descriptions of how the software is used by
everybody.

These descriptions of the software requirements are often referred to
as _User Stories_. Basically, each _story_ walks through one of the
ways in which the _planned_ software will be used.

### Keep Language Plain

The project can be discussed and understood best when the conversation
is had in terms that the user is comfortable with.

It is important to keep the language common and avoid tech talk such
that _everybody_ involved with the building and using the software can
participate in the conversation.

These user stories will later get broke down into specific tasks.

The real value to user stories is to create them like they are
recipes. Essentailly software is about writing recipes with very
strict rules.   

## The Good 'ol Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

An important result of the customer discovery session is a mutual
agreement on what the minimum or useful (viable) piece of software is,
which can be delivered as soon as possible.

The primary purpose of the MVP is to get stuff out the door, we
specifically want to avoid _disconnected development teams_.

Software can be properly managed just like construction projects. That
is only if the right processes and tools are established and enforced
throughout the product lifecycle.

> Read The [Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) to really understand how to get specific about
  building a product your target market will be crazy about.

This is an involved and very important topic. I will not attempt to
repeat nor summarize them in this document, but we will assume that we
have a pretty clear picture of the application we are developing, at
least enough for now.

## Tasks Are Small and Measurable 

The tasks that we come up with must be completed within a day or
two. Any task that requires three days or more should probably be
broken down into smaller bite-size tasks.

We do not want to create tasks so that they're too big, ambiguous or
subject to misinterpretation. If your team is not making progress in a
day or two you should be able to know what immediately.

Keeping the granularity of tasks small allows the team to _start
stacking victories quickly_ and more important, gives everybody a
chance to see when a software project is about to make a left turn.


### Goals are Most Effective When ...

Goals do not have to be obnoxious, obtuse and vague nor
pendantic. Just be real and reasonable.

If you want working software, provide a working set of goals.

- Few in Number, very Targeted
- Communicated in normal people language (user stories)
- Provide users quick and immediate value
- Prioritized to deliver _usable value_ incrementally
- Measurable and easy to determine when they are complete
- Everybody understands and agrees with the Goals
- Tasks should be 1-3 days max if possible (the will always be exceptions)

All these tasks have to add up to the MVP. Anything that does not
directly and immediately get the software project closer to an MVP
must be avoided.
