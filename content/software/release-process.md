  Once code has gone through the long process of being made ready for
  the end user it is time to let them have it.  But it is not over
  yet, bug reports and feature requests will start to flow in, you
  best be ready for them!

This is the point where software is ready to be passed along to the
user/customer, an _official release_. We will want to formalize the
process of releasing the softare.

For example, when a new release is cut, the following process may be in
place:

1. Commit to main in Github repository
2. New _version number_ is generated 
3. Automated build is triggered
3. Automated system tests are run
4. New binary test images are copied to a distribution server or
pushed to production servers
5. The actual process will vary according to many factors of the
application

With every successful software project you will be doing releases
regularly. It is best to make your release as easy and painless as
possible.

With any luck, the delivery of your very first copy of the software
will not be the last.

The journey has only just begun. You are going to be living with it
for a LONG time.

Make your software development process easy and predictable!
