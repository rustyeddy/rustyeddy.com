  Things really get interesting when users start using the new
  code. Bug reports and feature requests will start to flow in. Will you be
  ready to handle and respond to the requests?

This is the point where software is ready to be passed along to the
user/customer, an _official release_. We will want to formalize the
process of releasing the softare.

For example, when a new release is cut, the following process may be in
place:

1. Commit to main in Github repository
2. New _version number_ is generated 
3. Automated build is triggered
3. Automated system tests are run
4. New binary test images are copied to a distribution server or
pushed to production servers
5. The actual process will vary according to many factors of the
application

The main point to make at this point, one phase of the software
_development_ may have been completed, for example you delivered that
MVP!

However, the journey has only just begun! If your software is
successful, as I am sure it will be! You are going to be living with it
for a LONG time!

Make it easy and predictable!
