  Testing is the ultimate safety net for programmers.

1. Do not force your customers to find your bugs.
2. Good software becomes great, when old features become more reliable
   and new features resurect old bugs.

NOTE: This is when the customer sets objectives to the customer
acceptance. 

## Symptoms

### Software is always crashing or acting unpredictable
### Customers become the QA department (and get angry)
### Problems pop like a wack-a-mole
### Testing is tedious
### Testing resources are scarce and developers have very limited test time
### Development and Test enviromnent are very different than production

## Problems

## Solution ~ Test Driven Development

Begin the project by defining exactly what success is. Write an
automated test that will either verify or deny the outcome of the
test. 

### Tests become a development harness

Development is a very repetitve process. The more it can be automated
by taking away manual steps, the development process can be shortend
dramaticlly and keep the programmer on task!

## Testing Maintain Quality

Your customers will NOT be mad because you find the bugs before
they do!.

## What should be tested?

There are a variety of tests that /could/ be performed, but we are
going to focus on those tests that give us the most bang
for the buck.

## Acceptance Testing 

The big umberlla. Give the big boss a place they can weigh in on their
concerns.  Also, give your customer the assurance they need. If the
software does not work out to their satisfaction, they can always
smash the **Not Accepted** button.

Of course, they will be requested to give a full and descriptive
reason behind the failed test. 

> This is NOT a technical problem. This is a communication problem!
(Most likely).

### Test Plans For Everyone

Test Plans also help Ensure that the milestones and tasks Are
adequate. Well done test plans Tend to expose Gaps in software
architecture And in turn the planning process. 

It is critical that everybody Including management Understand the
tests And sign off on the test plans. 

## Before Development comes a Test Plan!

Do not start development before you have a test plan. Period. 

It can be simple, And it will not be complete, But it must precess
any development, And is required Prior to acceptance testing.
