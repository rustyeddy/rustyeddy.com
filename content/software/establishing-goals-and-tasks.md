  The necessary first step is to get clarity on what the software will
  do. The fewer and more specific your goals are stated the greater
  likelyhood of them being achieved. Tasks must be reasonable, 
  clear and measurable, delivering early value to the user.

Software can be properly managed just like construction projects, if
the right processes and tools are established and enforced throughout
the product lifecycle.

### Establishing Goals and Tasks

Like any project doing **anything** one must establish _Goals_, the
fewer and more specific, the better.

Before **any** activity starts, the leaders, users, developers and
everybody involved has got to be _crystal clear_ on what their most
immediate next task is.

> Read The [Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) to really understand how to get specific about
  building a product your target market will be crazy about.

This is an involved and very important topic. I will not attempt to
repeat nor summarize them in this document, but we will assume that we
have a pretty clear picture of the application we are developing, at
least enough for now.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Before we can do anything we must establish our _goals_, this can take
on many forms, such as the _Minimum Viable Product (MVP)_ established
by Eric Reis in the excellent book _Lean Startup_.

### Goals are Most Effective When ...

Goals do not have to be obnoxious, obtuse and vague nor
pendantic. Just be real and reasonable.

If you want working software, provide a working set of goals.

- Few in Number, very Targeted
- Communicated in normal people language (user stories)
- Provide users quick and immediate value
- Prioritized to deliver _usable value_ incrementally
- Measurable and easy to determine when they are complete
- Everybody understands and agrees with the Goals
- Tasks should be 1-3 days max if possible (the will always be exceptions)
