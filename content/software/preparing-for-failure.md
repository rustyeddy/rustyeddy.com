  Have You started Scheduling Pizza Runs 2:00am the night before AND

Every release, you swear you will apply the lessons learned from this
and previous mistakes to never repeat them resulting in predictable
stress free releases.

However, you are still ordering Pizza at 2:00am, not so because of
hunger, more so to ease the intense coffee buzz zinging in your head
yer the ol tummy a bit nautious. 

That is not a good comb with the pre-release stress knowing the
success of the company is directly related to the success of your
this software project.
