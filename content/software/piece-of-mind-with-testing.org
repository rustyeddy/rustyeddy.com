#+title: Piece of Mind with Testing
#+date: 2020-04-05

Please: **DO NOT** recruite your customers to be your /QA/
department. Especially if they are unanaware, thinking they are
getting a **usable** piece of software.

It is time to start adopting a /Test Driven Development (TDD)/
mindset. Even if you are knee deep into an existing development
project, get started building out our TDD now!
