* Symptoms

- Team is in a growing state of chaos
- Measuring Progress is impossible
- Measuring Quality is impossible 
- Budget tracking is impossible
- Team is loosing moral
- Team members are not working on the most important tasks
- The best team members leave

* Potential Problems

- No Clear, Reachable Objective Goals
- No Milestones or Milestones are not measurable (can be completed)
- Nobody /really/ understands the customers needs and wants
- The goals keep changing increasing confusion and waste
- Team leadership is not engaged with user before and during R&D

* The Solution

As a preface, before getting into the particulars of solving this
type of problem I would like to make it clear that this framework is a
direct [perhaps imperfect] reflection of the seminal works of Steve
Blank /Four Steps to Epiphany/  and Eric Ries and the /Lean Startup/,
as well as the **principals** of /Agile/ development.

In a nutshell, both of these movements, as well as the myriad of other
similar movements in nearly every industry is all about maintaining
close and constant communication with your /user/ iterating toward a
predicable and success conclusion to software projects.
