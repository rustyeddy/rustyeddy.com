  traceability.

Communication should be:

1. easy for everybody
2. captured to context, history for example, to capture the rationale
   behind decisions that may have required a controversial
   trade-off. Invaluable for repeating the same convesation. 

   Also can be used to determine when old practices can be
   obsoleted. Technology has a way obliterating completely rational
   decision that were made a mere two years ago..

3. Do NOT allow project communications To be spread amongst email,
   Texts, Social media accounts and various Other arbitrary Cyber
   nooks and crannies.

You will Lose all history and context. Debates and decisions Will be
unnecessarily repeated.
