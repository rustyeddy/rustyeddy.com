title: Organinizing Software Projects with Kanban
description: >
  Kanban is absurdly simple yet insainly useful! Just like your
  revision control system, you can not do without a Kanban board!

Expect the task list to be ever evolving. During the discovery session
and defining the MVP you will begin to identify an initial set of
tasks, and as the project precedes additional tasks will be realized.

Whenever and however a new task is identified, that task will be placed
on the kanban board in the to do list section.

The item is ordered in the to do list according to its priority
amongst the other tasks on the to do list.

## Stacking Small Victories

Keep the tasks small, quick turn arounds of less than an hour to a day
or two max. If tasks become three or four days they most likely can
and should be broken into smaller tasks.

This is important because the development team needs to see victories
and needs to have successes. Likewise management needs to see
progress as well and customers need to experience new features and
improvements. 

## Assigning Todo Items

As a person or resource becomes available, it is matched up with the
next task in the to do list according to the needs of the to task and
the skill of the person available.

The task or the kanban card is then assigned to that particular
person and moved into the Work In Progress (WIP) list. 

I am needing to explain kanban here because there're many good
references that do a better job than I could. Here are a couple that i
like:

- TODO Kanban explained youtube
- TODO Kanban explained webpage

To sum it up, the WIP(work in progress) keeps going until it is complete. This means tests have
passed and code reviews have as well.

Eventually the task is moved into the *Complete* column and the
software is delivered to the customer. (More on the software release
process later).

## Work In Progress

Take some time here to note things of particular interest while working
on a particular task.

Using github as an example, we can have our kanban card link to a
Github issue. That Github issue is then assigned to the person working
on a particular task.


### Project Tracking and Kanban

There are a lot ways to track project progress with _Project
Management_ tools, we are going to make it really simple 
[Kanban Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) type of card
list.

Kanban is about as simple and sufficient as it gets. [Todo Kanban reference]

### Github Projects

Github provides the relatively new (in 2020) feature called projects,
that allow one to easily create a Kanban board. Github projects allow
one to create a card and track it as a github issue.

allows you to define rows of tasks, for example "Todo", "Work In
Progress" and "Done". Cards are created with tasks and moved across
the board accordingly.

### Github Issues

Project cards represent a big picture wide array of tasks, it is the
"Github Issues" that track all of the actual coding work and changes
that take place.

_Github Projects_ allows a single click to convert a _Card_ into a
_Github Issue_ then allowing the issue to be tracked by the _Project
Card_ as the github issue does what it does tracking discussions and
changes through a new features lifetime.
