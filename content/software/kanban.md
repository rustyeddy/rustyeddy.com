title: Organizing Software Projects with Kanban
description: >
  Tracking tasks does not have to be Rocket Science, and it should not
  be.  Absurdly simple, profoundly liberating and insane to 
  ignore! We are going to look into Kanban.

Kanban is fantastically simple, we'll create a board with 3 columns,
Todo, Work In Progress and Complete.

Each column is populated with a single card for every task that must be
done. The cards are prioritised and move through the system as the
work progresses.

## Good Kanban Reference

> TODO add a good reference video to how Kanban works

The important things I take-a-way from the idea of Kanban is if:

- the tasks have been written in a 1-2 day granularity
- the _board_ is being updated regulary

Then _everybody_ will know exactly what progress has been made since
last reference.

### Task Lists Evolve 

We must embrace this fact. The tasks we began thinking about during
the _Customer Disovery_ session while defining the _MVP_ was probably
pretty accurate, but almost certainly _incomplete_.

> You can not know what you do not yet know

This is the most difficult rub in developing software in a novel way:

The reality is that unforeseen issues will pop up that must be added
to our _Todo_ list at any given time. We'll also find that many of our
original tasks were very high level and will necessarily be broken
down into compartmental tasks.

### Assigning Todo Items

As a person or resource becomes available, it is matched up with the
next task in the to do list according to the needs of the to task and
the skill of the person available.

The task or the kanban card is then assigned to that particular
person and moved into the Work In Progress (WIP) list. 

### Contstrainst on the WIP

A _prioritized Todo list_ and a _WIP_ that allows only a single (or
two) item(s) per person will help ensure the progress of the project
is visible to everybody that cares to look.

As items move from _Todo_ to _WIP_ to _Complete_ the 

## Stacking Small Victories

Keep the tasks small, quick turn arounds of less than an hour to a day
or two max. If tasks become three or four days, they most likely can
and should be broken into smaller tasks.

This is important because the development team needs to see victories
and needs to have successes. Likewise, management needs to see
progress, as well and customers need to experience new features and
improvements. 

Eventually, the task is moved into the *Complete* column and the
software is delivered to the customer. (More on the software release
process later).

### Github Projects

Github provides a relatively new (in 2020) feature called projects,
that allow one to easily create a Kanban board. Github projects allow
them to create a card and track it as a github issue.

This allows you to define rows of tasks, for example "Todo", "Work In
Progress" and "Done". Cards are created with tasks and moved across
the board accordingly.

### Github Issues

Project cards represent a big picture wide array of tasks, it is the
"Github Issues" that track all of the actual coding work and changes
that take place.

_Github Projects_ allow a single click to convert a _Card_ into a
_Github Issue_ which then allows the issue to be tracked by the _Project
Card_ as the github issue do what it does tracking discussions and
changes through a new features lifetime.
