Expect the task list to be ever evolving. During the discovery session
and defining the MVP You will begin to identify an initial set of
tasks, And as the project precedes additional tasks will be realized.

Whenever and however a new task Is identified that task will be placed
on the kanban board in the to do list.

The item is ordered in the to do list according to its priority
amongst the other tasks in the to do list.

## Stacking Small Victories

Keep the tasks small, quick turn arounds of less than an hour to a day
or two max. If tasks Become three or four days they most likely Can
and should be broke into smaller tasks.

This is important because the development team needs to see victories
and needs to have successes. Like wise management Needs to see
progress and customers need to experience new features and
improvements. 

## Assigning Todo Items

As a person or resource becomes available It is matched up with the
next task in the to do list According to the needs of the to Task and
the skill of the person available.

The task or the kanban Card Is then assigned to that particular
person and moved into the Work In Progress (WIP) list. 

I am knocking toReexplain kanban here because there're many good
referencesThey do a better job than I could, here are a couple that i
like:

- TODO Kanban explained youtube
- TODO Kanban explained webpage

To sum it up, the WIP keeps going until it is complete (tests have
passed and code reviews have as well).

Eventually the task is moved into the *Complete* column and the
software is delivered to the customer. More On the software release
process later.

## Work In Progress

Take some time here to note things of particular interest whileWorking
on a particular task.

Using github as an example, We can have our kanban card link to a
getup issue, That getup issue is then assigned to The person working
on a particular task.
