  Good software, even crappy software that is useful will live many
  lives (versions) and therefore should not be treated as a final
  destination. It should be treated as a flawed, flowing and ever
  changing entity.

> Good Software is Continually Improved

The greater the success software Is directly proportionate to The
number of features that are requested As well as the number of bugs
that are found. 

> Bug reports means your softwar is getting used.!.

That is obvious if people are happy using a software That they might
have some requests that would flow in from time to time. 

What might seem counterintuitive is the fact that, Even well done
successful software will have bugs. Period. Good teams understand and
embrace that... The Bugs will be fixed And the customers will be even
happier 

On the other hand, Bad software that is really buggy We'll never
really get used (the day of Micro$oft FUD are happy fading in the
past). 

### Bugs will exist

Even the cleanest home is going to have a bug somewhere, right? Yep,
same for software. We are going to embrace the bug, and then squish it
(electronically of course).

This will re-inforce your clients love for you. The rare bug they
do encounter get squashed and a fixed promptly and transparently roles
out to your customers.
