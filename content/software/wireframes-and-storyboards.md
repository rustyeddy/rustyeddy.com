## Software Development Process

### Story board and Wireframe

For me the is nothing better in the early part of designing a new
system and software is to begin the visualization process as early as
possible. 

#### Storyboards Walk Through Usecases

Storyboards ought to be created for the major _use-cases_, there should
be one _frame_ for each step in the _use-case_ should help bring forth
details of decisions that need to be made.

Storyboarding in evitably leads to more and more frames with growing
detail and notes.  By all means keep jotting down the notes they will
become important soon.

> The quality of the storyboard defines the quality of the User
> eXperience! 

#### Wireframe define The Story

Every click of a button or newly entered form typically takes the user
onto a new frame in the story, which also likely means a new web page,
or popup to look at and work with.

When the storyboard starts to take form, it is time to start nailing
down the _wireframes_ for the application.  Wireframes are going to:

1. Specify usage of every pience of screen real estate.
2. Identify specific content on each page
3. Identify all media for page (video, images, PDFs and CTA)
4. Clearly identified CTA
