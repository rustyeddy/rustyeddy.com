  I have started this little side project to gather industry best
  practices to design, build and deliver software.

This site is dedicated to collecting and adhering to our _Industries
Best Practices_. Since software in general is so broad, I am going to
focus this website on building application that fit in the _Internet
of Things (IoT)_ space.

This space typically focuses on building solutions within the
following technologies:

 - MicroServices
 - Embedded Systems 
 - Real Time Distributed Systems
 - Cloud Automation
 - Persistent Delivery 

Regardless of technology or industry, we are going to focus on the
timeless principals of building robust software that must perform
reliably.

Another extremely important nature of _Industrial Software_ is
delivery must be predictable and regular, not distrupting existing
production. Production and safety are on the line, bug fixes and
adapting to new technologies require the software to be truely both
_agile_ and _robust_.
