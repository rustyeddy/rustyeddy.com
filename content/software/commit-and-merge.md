## Github making the Commitment

Now it is time for the developer to commit the changes she has
made. This step is pretty simple, however, we want to make sure we are
doing it correctly.

When the code is merged into the **main** or **master** repository,
just like commitments, it will be accomponied by the log comments
that go along with the log files.

This can provide the viewer with literally a line by line replay of
the entire history of a software development project. The commitments
can also be directly related to the particular **github issues** that
spurred the updates to the code in the first place.

This is a very powerful way for not only developers, but also users,
management and marketing, as a quick way to summarize updates
to the software.

## Releasing Binaries and Packages

In many cases, it may be desirable or even mandatory to provide some
form of packaging around your application. For example in the case of Open Source
Go program, we might just provide the source repository and a
pre-built binary for certain platforms.
