## Paradise Ain't Perfect

Or maybe there is so much conflict that Hawaii doesn't look like it is
really **everybodies** **paradise**.

The point to all of this, a little bit of drilling down to all of the
passangers, the captiain and crew as well as the owner of the boat
would have all had better results.

If it was discovered before hand, that "Going to Hawaii", really
consisted of two groups: one going to Maui and one going to Kaui.

The two groups just a shared come commonalities.  However the final
destinations are very different.
