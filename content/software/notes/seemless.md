version of the software Hold your breath, Type in A 64 character
nonsensical string of gibberish, Click start, Listen to the CD start
the world. 

Hold your breath, And watch a number of minutes of a progress bar is
tick by.

And if all a successful you smileLittle little bit of breath out,
Opened version of the software hope everything is okay. Going to the
file menu to open up your backed up data, 

Hold your breath again, Click load And hope to high heaven and it read
your old data correctly.

If not, Call customer support, Prepare to wait for Possibly hours, Oh
