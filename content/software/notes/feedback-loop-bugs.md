  Software by nature has a builtin "feedback loop" with users. It
  stands to reason that the proper metering can produce very powerful
  insights toward your customer true desires.

1) Customer engagement happens before the product is created, during
   all of the the entire process (iterations) of the agile development
   process.

2) By this point, the customer engagement should be pretty well
   established adn that "bugs" should be handled similar to other
   communications. 


## Capturing Feedback

Make it easy for customers to talk to us. We want bug Reports so we
can squash them little bastards.

We want feedback, nobody wants to work on levers and gadgets that
nobody is going to use. 

The best feedback we can get is always going to be the people that use
the software, oh yea, and the people that pay for it.
