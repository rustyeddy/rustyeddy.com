Would it it strike fear in your heart if the doctor responsible
for saving your life only spoke /Gaelic/?

Well, can't imagine it feels any better knowing your team of
engineers, the ones responsible for the success of the software
project, and infact **directly** responsible for the success of your
company only speak /techalic/? (at /Galelic/ can be translated with
help of the Internet)
