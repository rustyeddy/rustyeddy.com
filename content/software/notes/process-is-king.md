  Software is a team sport. Everybody on the field, not just the

Having everybody involved in the process from the beginning
_gathering requirements_ through the end _supporting bugs_ to
delivering updates into a production environment. 

This is **only possible through process**, software is a team sport,
every player must, as Bill Belichick is famous for saying to his _6
time Suport Bowl Championship team_, "Just do you job."

I have created this section of my website as a place to collect the
_Software Development Best Practices_ on a mission to define _Just
Enough Process_ to keep projects organized, predictable, efficient and
a pleasure to work on. To that end I have put together a 6-part series
that _I believe_ are the **mandatory** ingredients to predictable
results and **peaceful** software releases.


## Embrace the Process

It will set you free! Believe it or not! 

If you embrace /a process/, I am /not/ talking about a intrusive oger
of tasks and reports that amount to throwing 6 inches of molases on a
race track just before a 100 yard dash.

No, not that, but 

## Just Enough Process (JEP)

Yep, /Just Enough Process (JEP)/ to keep the entire team organized,
tasks and goals /clearly/ stated and all vital communication recorded
for accuracy and perhaps posterity.

Yes, it is possible, not easy, but quite doable!
