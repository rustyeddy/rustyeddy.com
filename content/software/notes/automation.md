## And It is All Automated?

I read an article a couple days back (find reference) that made the
point:

> Once everything is automated, it is forgotten about until something

And that is a good thing! _Predictable Production Quality_ software starts and ends with
_Quality_. Low quality software 

## Lets Automate Everything!

OK! We will try to. But lets Except the very real probability. That we
won't be able to automate hundred percent Of everything Out of the
gate. And we may very well Be advised To perform manual testing.

Always. And Thouroughly.

Not testing for any reason Is not acceptable. The only acceptable
answer tonight testing Is no delivery.

That's More than enough To motivate us To automate As completely And
thoroughly as possible.
