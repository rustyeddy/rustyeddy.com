  Acceptance Tests are the official criteria that will determine if *all users* of the software are happy.

One of the first things that ought to be done, but seldom get the
attention it needs are the specific criteria that must be met to make
the customer/user happy. 

We are going to call this group of criteria the projects **Acceptance
Test**. Ideally all acceptance tests can be automated with software,
however they may be cases that manual intervention is required to
conduct an entire set of Acceptance tests.

## Whitebox vs. Blackbox Testing

My intention here's not to get into a dissertation on testing in test
methodologies. Rather I would like to point out a couple very
important and fundamental types of tests thatMust be conducted.

That includes both white box and blackbox tests. White box tests are
done with access to the internal details of the software, These are
typically represented by unit tests.

Blackbox tests on the other hand no access to the internal structure
of the software. Rather the tests are conducted from a systematic for
external point of view, just as an end user of the software we'll be
expecting this software to behave. 

## Acceptance Tests are Blackbox

The acceptance tests are by definition, what the customer expects the
software to do, and has in effect agreed to be happy with the software
once it passes acceptance tests.
