  I am a developer with modest design skills on a good day, and no

  designer in me to produce good looking and professional UIs at
  least I think so, what do you think?.

Thankfully the Internet is full of great designers with kind soles
that have distilled their years
of _training_, _experience_ and most of all _personal direction_ into
a set of general guidelines and formulas that make even no-talents
like myself look like a pro!

[TODO Give some credits and reference some of these folks].

## My Prespective on UI Design

At the moment of this writing I am in the processes of building a
startup. I am in the _customer discovery_ phase.

> Startup_ principals, which means that I need to rapidly iterate

My biggest pain point with UI design at the moment is the need to
change it quickly, while plugging it into a _backend_ that may be an
existing production service or a _mockup_ of a service that is to be.

Basically, I need to be able to show people the future that I can help
create for them. In turn, they need to tell me the future they _want
to have_ created for them.

### People Expect Beautiful

The days are gone when you could slap up an Ugly interface and expect
to amass a large user base like craigslist. Or at least it is much
harder now that user expectations are up. 

I need to build a UI that /looks and acts/ like the finished
application, because that is the only %100 sure wat if my app will be
used by my customer.

If we work together we can iterate ourselve to _meeting of minds_ were
I can begin to build a product or service solution that my client can
NOT wait to pay me for.

### UI Designed By Users

Ideally, I really want my users to design the UI _with_ me. I enjoy
doing _interactive design sessions_ where the user(s) are watching as
I make changes and start getting feedback.

Every full iteration needs to be viewed and _accepted_ by the
customer, and hence the need for acceptance testing.

I want to be able to iterate through UI's in a _scientific_ manner
building the ultimate _User Experience_ by optimizing through test,
measurements and feedback.


## The Design Process - Understanding the User

We need to understand the user and how they expect to, or would like
to interact with the backend software that this front end is being
made for.


## Storyboard and Wireframing

Identify a single /Persona/ and a specific **use case** one of each,
period. 

Storyboard that use-case meaning draw each step the client will make
through the journey of purchase.

### Wireframes

Paper for me. In the beginnings wireframes do not have a ton of
detail. You can also leave out the copy by replacing text with
appropriately weighted and sized squiggly lines.

> Todo: Take a shot of one my wireframes and place here, that'd be
> cool, right?

1. Wireframe every unique page or template
   1. One wireframe per reusable template is fine!
2. Give every section of every page an identity
   1. We will use it to track our media inventory

At the end of the day we are going to either want or be required to
produce a User Interface that is "flawless" to some reasonable extent,
to do this, every piece of every page needs to sport a design that
consistent with the rest of the site. 

We may as well do the best we can thinking the site, pages and purpose
of every page.

### Style Guide

1. Font Families for Header and Body
2. Fix font sizes and styles for all elements
3. Figure out spacing, white space is good

1. Color Palate, including all shades

1. Color Use Guidelines
   1. White text on images always

3. Create a Manifest for all Required content
   1. Inventory content: location if ready, assigned todo if it needs
      to be created ready.
