Consists of one or more customer discovery sessions, where all *users*
and *owners* of The software will be interviewed forTheir expectations
needs and desires from the upcoming software project.

The customer discovery is then turned into user stories, which are
then vetted to collected inhe user storiesAre broke down into Tasks
that are Small, autonmous and measurable.

The test that we come up with must be completed within a day or
two. Any task that requires three days or more probably should be
broke down into smaller bite-size tasks.

We do not want to creator cast so that they're big ambiguous and
subject to misinterpretation. If your team is not making progress in a
day or two you should be able to know what immediately.

### User Stories

The project can be discussed and understood best when the conversation
Is had in terms that the user is comfortable with.

The real value to user stories is to create them like they are
recipes. Alternately software or writing programs  are defining
recipes with very strict rules.  

### MVP

An important result of the customer discovery session Is a mutual
agreement on what the minimum or useful (viable) piece of software can
be Delivered as soon as possible.

The MVP is then broke down into specific Tasks and perhaps milestones.

The tasks and milestones are turned into cards placed on The to do
list of our kanban board.
