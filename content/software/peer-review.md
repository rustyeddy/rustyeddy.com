  having our work scrutized by peers before letting hit the general

A _Peer Review_ is the process of _one or more peers_ knowledgable
about your code who can examine and scrutinize every line.  This is a painful
process, but so necessary.

## Peer Reviews Are Painful but Worth IT!

For the programmer, that means having your work criticized by other
people. Maybe even people that _think_ they are smarter than you, but are
not.

Reviewers, typically don't like (or at least don't *love*) reviewing other peoples
code. It is a lot of extra work. It's hard and takes time.

Even worse, it involves human emotion and opinions that we have to
work through, yuck.!.

To feed the flames, tech people are **notorious** for being downright
rude and abrupt. No room for sensitivity, just straight to facts and 
opinions.

We have to learn to listen, respect and speak up for this to work. There
is no other way. I won't bring this up again, however:

> superior human interaction is required for superior results. 

Projects that treat each other kindly and keep the best outcome with the
project as topic of debate, we will end up with successful results and
people that like each other. 

### Peer Reviews and Pull Requests

Good 'ol _github_ comes through again! Github has sort of invented
this feature called a _Pull Request_ that are the perfect vehical to
perform peer reviews.

The PR makes it easy for _reviewers_ to view the exact changes made to
the code. It also allows reviewers and the developers to record
conversation that rationalized the current state of code, and changes
that were requested by reviewers and how the developer responds.

Sometimes interesting fodder, but now it is time ...
