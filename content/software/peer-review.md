  Making changes to code on ones own in isolation can be problematic
  for a number of reasons, however, when you get a pair of scrutinizing
  eyes on your code, all sorts of things are going to come up that you
  probably had not considered.

A _Peer Review_ is the process of _one or more peers_, knowledgable
about your code, examine and scrutinize every line.  This is a painful
process but so necessary.

## Peer Reviews Are Painful but Worth IT!

For the programmer, that means having your work criticized by other
people. Maybe even people _think_ they are smarter than you, but are
not.

Reviews, don't like (or at least don't *love*) reviewing other peoples
code. It is a lot of extra work, it's hard and takes time.

Even worse, it involve human emotion and opinions, that we have to
work through, yuk.!.

To feed the flames, tech people are **notorious** for being downright
mean and abrupt. No room for sensitivity just straight to facts and
brash opinions.

We have to learn to listen, respect and speak for this to work. This
is no other way, I won't bring this up again, however:

> superior human interaction is required for superior results. 

Projects that treat each other kindly and keep the best outcome the
project as topic of debate, we end up with successful results and
people that like each other. 

### Peer Reviews and Pull Requests

Good 'ol _github_ comes through again! The process known as _pull
requests_ essentially has the developer that has private code changes
she wants to put them back into mainline has the ability to _post_ the
changes for _review_ via a _pull request_.

The PR makes it easy for _reviewers_ to view the exact changes made to
the code. It also allows reviewers and the developer to record

Now it is time to make a commitment.
