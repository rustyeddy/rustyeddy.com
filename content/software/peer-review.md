  Making changes to code on ones own in isolation can be problematic
  for a number of reasons, however, when you get a pair of scrutinizing
  eyes on your code, all sorts of things are going to come up that you
  probably had not considered.

### Peer Review aka Pull Request 

Github has long since provided support for the concept of a _pull
request_. One way to think about it is a request to _pull your
changes_ into the main line.

One great benefit it provides is the platform for new and changed code
to be ~~scrutinized~~ and reviewed.

This is the point that you can start increasing your confidence in the
code. We now have tests that are passing and we have had the code
under scrutiny (peer review). It has passed both water marks.

Now it is time to make a commitment.
