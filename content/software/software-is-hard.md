## Why Is Software So Difficult?

Software development projects are one of the most notoriously
mis-understood and broken processes. There are a number of reasons,
not the least of which is the extent that software is abstract and it
does abstract things, most of the time.

- One reason is that you can't see it.
- Most people have no idea what programming really is
- There is no single right way to do software
- Software is a combination of Art, Science and Engineering
- It changes very fast

A couple having their _Dream House_ built does not have to have to
know much about construction to get a sense of how well progress is
moving along on their _dream_ house.

Software is much harder to track, by it's very nature. However, just
as construction projects can easily go off rails, _software projects_
can steadily diverge from the users end expectations without anybody
noticing.
