  Software development projects have a nasty reputation for getting
  out of control and being difficult to manage and complete. For
  starters, software can not be seen and it usually automates complex
  topics. This article will identify some of the reasons software is
  so difficult and how we can start running successful projects.

## Why Is Software So Difficult?

Software development projects are one of the most notoriously
mis-understood and incorrectly managed of all the _common_ processes
used throughout the business world.

There are a number of reasons for this chaos. Software often is solving a
complex problem, that unfortunately you can't see. But perhaps the worst 
problem with software projects are the diverging expectations between
developers and users. 

## Software is Not Regulated

Another reason software projects are capable of running so far amok is
a lack of regulations. Please note, I am not in favor of external
regulation, however, I am a _huge_ advocate of education,
communication and following _Best Practices_.

For people that do not really understand how _software_ works, it can
be a nightmare. After all, who can you trust?

There are **no laws or regulations** to monitor and enforce that
the software development processes and procedures have been performed
correctly, leaving the buyer with what they asked for (but better).

As developers, managers and users, we all want:

> The Correct Software Developed Correctly

### Many ways to Skin a Cat

While it is true that there is no single _correct_ way to do software, it is
also true there are _many ways_ to do software _incorrectly_.

Software development is largely a collection of _Best Practices_ which
are heavily influenced by the application you are building, the "tech
stack(s)" being used and the specific culture of the organization.

I am hoping to collect a set of _Best Practices_ for small teams of
developers building small agile applications, particularly aimed at
the _Industrial IoT_ aka _Industrial Automation_ market.

The lessons and processes captured here are meant to be timeless and
translate well across industries, development styles and "tech stacks".

Bottom line: when the users, management, marketing and developers
have regular and effective communication, the _Software Development
Process_ becomes

> Predictable

The lack of predictability can be quickly identified with a disconnect
between the _expectations of the user_ and the load, expectations and
capabilities of the developers.

## Communication Breakdown

Most of these problems are rooted in mis-understanding,
mis-communications or just missed assumptions. When a user and a
developer say a "Database of Shoes" many, often conflicting ideas of
what that means come about.

### What the User Thinks

I will have a "Database" with all my shoes in it, it will have forms
and be easy to use, searchable and I can easily change the order of
queries, and ...

### What the Developer Thinks

I'll give her a JSON file to start with and we'll work from there...

### Who is Right?

In reality, both of these parties have a legitimate definition of a
_Database_ depending on the context and the community you are talking
to.

There lie's the rub, we have two communities: users and developers, who have 
two different mindsets (I want ...) and (I can just ...) which start to diverge and
the conflict begins.

## When does resolution come?

When a project takes a left turn, the resolution can start as soon as
the divergence has been identified.

This is the most critical aspect of agile: the ability to detect and
stop a software project that is about to take a left turn before it actually does.

### Death Signs of a Software Project

Here are three clear signs (there are many more), but these are the
biggies:

1. Developers Hording Code - not letting users see it
2. Users not committed to the succuss of the project - no feedback to developers that have been building software
3. Feature creep - Users don't engage and developers don't expose

_Feature creep_ is really a combination of 1&2 above. Users avoid the
work of actually using the software. Developers avoid the work of
making it regularly available for use, testing and scrutiny.

## Best Practices

Let start this journey and figure out how to _manage predictable
software projects_. Whatever the application, technology and
industry is, we can be sure

> Communication is the foundation of predictability and success.

So, where to start ...
