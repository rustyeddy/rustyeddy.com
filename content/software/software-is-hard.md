## Why Is Software So Difficult?

Software development projects are one of the most notoriously
mis-understood and incorrectly managed of all the _common_ processes
used throughout the business world.

There are a number of reasons for software projects being classified
as a disastor so often. Software often is solving a complex problem
that unfortunately can't be seen.

Perhaps the worst problem with software projects are the diverging
expectations between developers and users.

## Software is Not Regulated

Another reason software projects are capable of running so far amok is
a lack of regulations.

> Please note, I am not in favor of external regulation, I am, however
a _huge_ advocate of transparency, education, communication and
following industry _Best Practices_.

For people that do not really understand how _software_ works, it can
be a nightmare trying to figure out what needs to be, who the best
people for the job are, etc.

After all, who can you trust?

There are **no laws or regulations** that will ensure that the outcome
of your software project will be what you wanted.

As developers, managers and users, we all want:

> To Develop the Correct Software, Correctly.

### There Are Many ways to Skin a Cat

While it is true that there is no single _correct_ way to do software, it is
also true there are _many ways_ to do software _incorrectly_.

Software development is largely a collection of _Best Practices_ which
are heavily influenced by the application you are building, the "tech
stack(s)" being used and the specific culture of your organization.

We are here, to identify the _good practices_ and renounce the _bad
practices_.

The lessons and processes captured here are meant to be timeless and
translate well across industries, development styles and "tech stacks".

Bottom line: we want to employ _Just Enough Process_ to learn to run
stress free, successful software development projects. Software
projects that I like to call 

> Predictable.

The lack of predictability can be quickly identified with a disconnect
between the _expectations of the user_ and the activities of the
development team.  The worst enemy of predictability is a ...

## Communication Breakdown

Most of these problems are rooted in mis-understanding,
mis-communications or just missed assumptions.

For example, let's say a _user_ asks a developer for a "Database of
Shoes". Many conflicting ideas of what _exactly_ does _a Database_
mean anyway?

### What the User Thinks

The _user_ likely think they are going to get an entire usable
Database with typical functionality like entering data with _forms_,
being able to perform complex _searches_ and apply sophisticated
_filters_ to present only the shoe data they need.

### What the Developer Thinks

The _developer_ on the otherhand may be interpreting the task more
literally.

She may be thinking: I'll give the _user_ a _JSON_ file with a
bunch of shoes for the database.  We can add things like _entry forms_
and _search filters_ in the future.

### Who is Right?

In reality, both of these parties have a legitimate definition of a
_Database_ depending on the context and the community you are talking
to.

There lie's the rub, we have two communities: users and developers, who have 
two different mindsets (I want ...) and (I can just ...) which start to diverge and
the conflict begins.

## When does resolution come?

Projects that start to _diverge_ can be put back on path as soon as
the divergence has been identified. When there is _regular,
meaningful_ communication between all parties divergences are small
and resetting is quick.

If there are large gaps in communication between interested parties,
then the divergence between what _is developed_ vs. what _was wanted_
can grow large, even beyond the point of recovery.

Agile software development, in it's truest form provides the means to detect and
stop a software project that is about to take a left turn before it actually does.

### Death Signs of a Software Project

Here are three of the biggest signs a _Software Project_ is headed for
disastor:

1. Developers Hording Code - not letting users see it
2. Users not committed to the succuss of the project - developers get
no feedback from actually running code.
3. Feature creep - Users don't engage and developers don't expose

_Feature creep_ is really a combination of 1&2 above. Users avoid the
work of actually using the software. Developers avoid the work of
making it regularly available for use, testing and scrutiny.

_Developers_ must be ready _release_ software changes frequently an
rapidly to a _user_ base that will provide prompt and useful feedback
about the new software being release.

If these two things happen, chances of a successful and predictable
software project increase significantly.

## Best Practices

Let start this journey and figure out how to _manage predictable
software projects_. Whatever the application, technology and
industry is, we can be sure

> Communication is the foundation of predictability and success.

So, where to start ?
