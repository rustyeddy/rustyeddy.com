If you have been involved with a software development project of
significant size, they can quickly feel like they are spinning
out of control, and evermore slipping behind ever agressive deadline?

If so, I created a cool little _Software Project Starter Kit_ you may
find helpful (and calming!). This guide is not about _programming_
rather is is all about the _process_ of **delivering** _production_
software. 

## The Process will Set You Free

I have worked on over a hundred software projects, a few great
successes, some honorable mentions, and a couple miserable failures. 

It has been my observation that successful projects tend to all have
_just the right process_ in place. The projects that failed did so for
a variety of reasons, which often included no process to too much
process. 

> No process leads to chaos, bugs and arguments. Too much process
> kills efficiency, creativity and morale.

I have created this section of my website as a place to collect the
_Software Development Best Practices_ on a mission to define _Just
Enough Process_ to keep projects organized, predictable, efficient and
a pleasure to work on. To that end I have put together a 6-part series
that _I believe_ are the **mandatory** ingredients to predictable
results and **peaceful** software releases.

### Why I am doing this?

I am a Software Engineer and I love what I do, at least most of the time.
When things suck it is usually because of unreasonable expectations,
or a team ruled by chaos.  

> I want to avoid suck projects.

The people that I work for, my clients, customers, employers and users
all deserve the absolute best from my knowledge and experience, in
addition to my present day skills.

> I want to provide the best possible service for my clients, and free
> my team to focus on their strengths by establishing _Just Enough
> Process_. 

I am hell bent on understanding and providing my clients _predictable_
software projects delivered on time and in budget. It makes my life
soooo much easier, and it's great for business. But most important, it
is the best thing for my clients!  

## The Software Project Starter Kit

In this series I have established, what I believe are the 6 critical
resources that ***must*** be part of every ***serious*** software
project. We will get into _what_ the typical problems are, what we
can do to avoid these problems followed by a demonstration of these
processes using 100% free tools and Open Source software.
