Ever get overwhlemed or feel stress coming on, everytime you think or
talk about the software project?  If any of the following problems
seem to be recurring issues:

1. The team does not seem to all be in sync
2. Management has little to no visibility on progress of the project
3. Deadlines are consistently missed
4. Your customers are debugging your software (and getting angry)
5. You can't seem to find programmers that communicate very well

These are just 5 examples of the type of problems I have run across
time and time again. Software is hard And there're good reasons for
these problems. Software is hard, But when you get it right, If you
can change your business.

## This arcticle will help

I have been developing software for 3+ decades and have witnessed many
dismal failures and some smashing successes. There are elements of
successful projects and failures that are obvious, but

If you have experienced or would like to potentially avoid some of
these problems, join in my journey to define _Predictible Software
Development_. 

## How to make software predictable

Here is a high level overview of Practices that you can start doing to
improve your software development project. If you have the luxury
of being at the beginning of a project you can just follow these
guidelines straight away.

Otherwise if you're knee-deep into an existing project, You still can
and should adopt these practices to implement them as much and as soon
as possible in your existing project.
