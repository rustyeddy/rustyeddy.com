I am going to build a modern software application using all web
technologies. It will be a Single Page App (SPA) using Go on the
backend and Vue.js on the front.

## We will Use

Go and a couple package by Gorilla will serve up the HTML, CSS and
JavaScript. Go will also provide a REST API and Websocket interface,
with an MQTT client coming soon.

JavaScript and Vue.js will be used on the front end, for a totally
reactive and modern user experience.

## We will Build

An internet clock. We'll use a Raspberry Pi with a 7" touch
screen. Though any old browser will do.  The clock will be connected
to the Internet with the following features available:

- Never need to set the clock, it uses internet NTP
- 

## We will Run
