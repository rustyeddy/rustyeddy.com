title: The Process of Delivering Predictable Software
description: > 
  Software is hard to do correctly, and even harder to deliver on time
  and within budget. It is my goal to assemble some case studies and
  establish software development best practices, with the explicit
  goal of making software development projects more predictable.

## The Process is Timeless the Tools are Free

This collection of articles will lay a solid foundation for starting
and even right siding a software development project that has gone off
the rails. You can use these nuggets as guiding light for the software
development projects you lead.

The process of developing software that is covered on the following
pages is _timeless_, all the principals will translate across _"tech
stacks"_ and _decades_ Here are some timeless principals, while still
being aware of the rapid innovations in technology of today.

## Practical Examples to Timeless Principals

We will use the ubiquitous Github for examples.

The processes and tools used in this document are 100% free, however
the principals supported and studied can translate into many very
different eco-systems, free and paid.

## The Process In a Nutshell

All good software comes with Just Enough Process nobody wants to be
bogged down in bureaucracy, other than a bureaucrat. So we will be
touching on some of the important elements of process.

### The Big Idea - MVP

This module we go over ways to conduct an efficient Application
Discovery session to determine how we want our application to
behave. Then we draw a line in the sand and set out to build our
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) 

### Wireframes and Walkthroughs

With our MVP firmly settled on, we are going to start drawing up the
screens a users story will encounter on their journey through the
application.  The wire-frames will provide us with a storyboard we can
walk our user step by step on how they expect to use the app.

### Software Architecture and Design

The Wire-frames and walk through give the user a good sense of how the
application is going work, the Architecture is going to tell
developers what needs to be built. 

### Data Models and the API

Wire-frames tell us what pieces of data the app will consume and store
(Data Model). The architecture helps define the Application
Programming Interface (API) our application will provide. 

### Version Control and Repositories

### Design Guide

### Tasks and the Kanban

### Fixing Bugs and Adding New Features
