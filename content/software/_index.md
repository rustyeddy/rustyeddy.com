description: > 
  Software is hard to do correctly, and even harder to deliver on time
  and within budget. This page is dedicated to assembling some case
  studies and establish software development best practices, with the
  explicit goal of making software development projects more predictable.

## The Process is Timeless the Tools are Free

This collection of articles will lay a solid foundation for starting
and even right siding a software development project that has gone off
the rails. You can use these nuggets as guiding light for the software
development projects you lead.

The process of developing software that is covered on the following
pages is _timeless_, all the principals will translate across _"tech
stacks"_ and _decades_ Here are some timeless principals, while still
being aware of the rapid innovations in technology of today.

### Practical Examples to Timeless Principals

We will use the ubiquitous Github for examples.

The processes and tools used in this document are 100% free, however
the principals supported and studied can translate into many very
different eco-systems, free and paid.
