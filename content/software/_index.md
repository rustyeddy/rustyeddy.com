title: Notes on Running Predictable Software Projects
description: > 
  Software is hard to do correctly, and even harder to deliver on time
  and within budget. This page is dedicated to assembling some case
  studies and establish software development best practices.

Do you lead or manage software a project but you lack the time and or
background to:

- Develop a fully vetted systems architecture
- Establish "just enough" process for a small team to maximize
  efficiency. 
- Build a team and mentor JR members
- Establish coding practice and perform code Survey's and Reviews

I have been developing software for 3+ decades and have witnessed many
dismal failures and some smashing successes. There are elements of
successful projects and failures that are obvious, but

If you have experienced, or would like to potentially avoid some of
these problems, join in my journey to define _Predictible Software
Development_. 

## What my team does for Your Team

1. Establish your project true and measurable objective, by drilling
   down to well up the **true** requirements
2. Map the **true** requirements to bite sized measurable tasks with
   clearly defined objectives that can be measured and checked.
3. Global visibility as to the progress of the project
4. Present management and marketing with tools to communicate
   customers desires and operational issues into future software
   releases
5. Define and automate the entire testing and release processes.
6. Consult with the developers on the team to focus everybody toward a
   singular goal and bring the entire team up to speed ASAP.
   
   
## Software is a Team Sport

Which implies you must have the right team. The _World Series_ is not
won by a team of just good "baseball players", you have to have a few
lights out pitchers, a golden glove short stop and fast out fielders
with good arms.  And you have to have a hitting squad that can
cummulatively put points on the board in a consistent manner.

Have you suffered from a disconnect with your development team, or
as a lead developer have to deal with an unreasonable HIPPO?
