title: Notes on Running Predictable Software Projects
description: > 
  Software is hard to do correctly, and even harder to deliver on time
  and within budget. This page is dedicated to assembling some case
  studies and establish software development best practices.

Do you lead or manage a software  project but you lack the time and or
background to:

- Develop a fully vetted systems architecture
- Establish "just enough" process for a small team to maximize
  efficiency. 
- Build a team and mentor JR members
- Establish coding practice and perform code Surveys and Reviews

I have been developing software for 3+ decades and have witnessed many
dismal failures and some smashing successes. There are elements of
successful projects and failures that are obvious, but

If you have experienced or would like to potentially avoid some of
these problems, join in my journey to define _Predictible Software
Development_. 

## What my team does for Your Team

1. Establish your project with true and measurable objectives, by drilling
   down to the **true** requirements
2. Map the **true** requirements to bite sized measurable tasks with
   clearly defined objectives that can be measured and checked off
3. Global visibility as the project progresses 
4. Provide management with tools to convert 
   customers desires to project objectives
5. Define and automate the entire test and release processes
6. Build and mentor your development team, perform code audits and reviews
   
   
## Software is a Team Sport

This implies you must have the right team. The _World Series_ is not
won by a team of just good "baseball players", you have to have a few
lights out pitchers, a golden glove short stop and fast outfielders
with good arms. You also must have a hitting squad that can
cummulatively put points on the board in a consistent manner.
