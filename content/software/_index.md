  Software is hard to do correctly, and even harder to deliver on time
  and within budget. This page is dedicated to understanding our
  biggest problems and how to fix them.

Do you lead or manage software projects? If so, have you experienced
_communication breakdown_ between the devteam and management and even
support? 

If you have experienced, or would like to potentially avoid some of
these problems, join in my journey to define _Predictible Software
Development_. 

## Suffering any of the following problems?

I have made a list the typical symptoms that I have seen, as well as a
quick survey with some collegues:

1. Communication Break Down between the Dev team and
   Management. Ego's, lake of _Emotional Intellegence_, conflicting or
   disfunctional often are the root cause. 

2. Lack a clear measurable goal, more specifically a [series of] short
   clear, easy to finish series of goals that are immediately vetted
   by the customer. Scope creep and waste due to stacking errors.

3. The classic problems of a schedule that has no clear bound, a
   budget, which does have a bound is rapidly nearing an end of
   funding. Lack of visi

4. No well understood process around how features are added, tested
   and finally released to the customer.
   
5. Missed customer expectations. The longer a peice of code exists
   before it is excersized by the user, the higher the probability
   that code will be deemed useless.
   
6. Once again, **software is a team sport** which implies you must
   have the right team. The _World Series_ is not won by a team of
   just good "baseball players", you have to have a few lights out
   pitchers, a golden glove short stop and fast out fielders with good
   arms.  And you have to have a hitting squad that can cummulatively
   put points on the board in a consistent manner.

   > perform a well picked staff that combines key skills while moving
   > temporary skills in and out.


Have you suffered from a disconnect with your development team, or
as a lead developer have to deal with an unreasonable HIPPO?


### Scope Creep

Do the requests keep growing, forcing an ever growing
list of new but "pre-beta" software in a code base resulting in large
_diffs_ of pending changes.
