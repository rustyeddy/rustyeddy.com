Agile **help** fix the problem but is insufficient with out some other
critical elements, the foremost element is actually adapting the
**spirit of agile** and living it day to day.

If we as leaders do not have a mountain top to point our troops to,
then lead them along the way, ensuring that _shiney objects_, missed
turns and **little side journey's** we will wonder around in the
wilderness for 40 weeks before we all starve to death because the
_manna_ quit falling from the heavens.
