Alchemy Networks is an indepently owned service provider. They began
offering private cloud services to their clients. I helped them
automate the provisioning of their clients private cloud as part of
the clients on-boarding process.

The objective of this project was to automate provisioning of
CloudStack on a Xen Server for new clients, the clients are then able
to use cloud stack to provision there own virtual machines with
license free Open Source software.
