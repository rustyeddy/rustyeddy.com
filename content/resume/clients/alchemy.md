Alchemy Networks is an indepently owned service provider. I automated
the provisioning of their Private Cloud Service offering. I was an
individual contributor on this project, I worked loosely with one
other developer.

The objective of this project was to automate provisioning of
CloudStack on a Xen Server for new clients, the clients are then able
to use cloud stack to provision there own virtual machines with
license free Open Source software.
