The past 15 I have worked with many clients and many projects. I have
been a single developer, as well as build aand lead teams of 10 to 20
engineers. I am first and foremost a programmer, however, I have
worked with clients to scope project requirements, establish 
budgets and schedules, design software architecture and
lead teams of engineers through entire software development
lifecycles.
