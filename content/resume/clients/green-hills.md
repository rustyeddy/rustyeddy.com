I worked on a small team that added multicast forwarding to the _Integrity_ RTOS
kernal.  Modified multicast routing daemon to run on same operating
system allowing the product to serve as the foundation for a military
grade network switch/router.  Added IPv6 Neighbor Discovery to the
suite of routing protocols.
