I worked with DirecTV during the purchase and transition to AT&T. I
was hired by DirecTV to build and lead the Software Defined Network
(SDN) Architecture team to design the new generation of multicast
video delivery network.

DirecTVs video delivery network responsible for getting video feeds
from various sources to the customers, was built from equipment that
was coming to _end of life_.

I was hired to architect the SDN replacement solution, as well as over
see the proof of concept. So we developed a SDN to IPv4 multicast
gateway.  The work was primarily Java, ONOS and Openflow, with large
doses of computer networking and routing.
