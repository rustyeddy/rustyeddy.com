I am a Software Engineer with over three decades of building software
and leading teams of software engineers, and others. My primary
experience and interest is Computer Networks, Real Time Communication,
Distributed Systes, MicroServices and DevOps. _My technologies are Go,
C/C++, Python and JavaScript. In the past I also know other language
well such and PHP, Java and Lisp._

I am interested in consulting projects for Software Design, Team
Building, Establish Software Process and CI/CD pipelines. I can also
be hired as a lead programmer in aras of MicroController development,
MicroServices and Cloud Automation. It does not take much to get me
started and successful contributing.
