***So, Who are you?***

My name is George Eddy, my friends call me Rusty.  I live in
Huntington Beach, CA with my family.  I was born and raised in
Southern California, Educated at CSULB and USC. I have worked in the
Aerospace Industry, Computer Networking, Telecom and the Entertainment
Industries. 

***What do you do?***

I am Software Engineer and Network architect. I still write a lot of
software, and these days, I am particularly interested in managing IoT
devices, the maker movement and ComputerVision.

I like working on hard problems with talented people.

***What have you worked on in the past?***

Lot's of really cool things, some big complex projects as well as
interesting proof of concept research projects.  

Most of these involve computer networks, Real Time applications
and/or high availability services.  There are plenty of other
things that I have built, but these are what I consider my "Core
Strengths". 

***What Roles and Titles have you had?***

Principal Engieer, Technical Lead, Member of The Technical Staff,
Senior Software Engineer and Systems Programmer are some of my
previous Job titles.

I throughouly enjoy being a technical lead, mentoring Jr. engineers and high level
architecture.  However, I am also a very hands on programmer.

I have worked for Fortune 500 companies including AT&T, Cisco Systems,
McDonnel Douglas (now Boeing) and USC/ISI.

I have also worked with startups and small businesses.  I really enjoy
early stage projects and small agile teams of diverse and talented
people.
