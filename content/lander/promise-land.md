  Celebrating the start of an exciting project ends such that the
  first was the only celebration. Somehow everybody died before they
  could realise the dream. A lack of true focus, and dead reckoning
  on what the promise is. The only way to declare victory is to know 
  exactly when you have crossed the finish line.

## Whorra, Whorra, Whoora, What to do?

_On The Other Hand_ could you imaging running a project that was
**predictible**, where developers where productively adding features
most requested by your most valuable _customers_.

How about a software team that is able to repeatedly, identify, fix,
testing and release the few bugs found in production with a matter of
hours vs. days or weeks?

Real fixes, these are not **special** versions of code for that
_special customer_. 

Software, whose every fix and feature goes into a more robust, feature
rich company asset.

## But there is a promise land ...

Going to Hawaii the first time, back in the days of no _Internet_ my
wife and I took a trip to Hawaii for the first time.  We went with
friends and ended up in Maui, (Napili Kai? forgot the place), it was nice!

Loved the trip.

### Paradise Ain't Perfect

The second trip was to Kaui, very different places. Kaui is my choice,
I know a lot of others that head to Maui.  If you get in a boat with a
group of people some of which want to go to Kaui, some want to go to
Maui, chances are at least half of voyagers are going to be
dis-appointed.

### It's Great, but which Island?

Or perhaps the boat makes a compromise and lands somewhere in between
that nobody wants to do.
