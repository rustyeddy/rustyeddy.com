We live in a connected world, and modern software has to navigate this
world. So the building blocks for tomorrow's very largest solutions
are connected and massively parallel. It's not enough for code to be
"strong and silent" any more. Code has to talk to code. Code has to be
chatty, sociable, well-connected. Code has to run like the human
brain, trillions of individual neurons firing off messages to each
other, a massively parallel network with no central control, no single
point of failure, yet able to solve immensely difficult problems. And
it's no accident that the future of code looks like the human brain,
because the endpoints of every network are, at some level, human
brains.  

Connecting computers is so difficult that software and services to do
this is a multi-billion dollar business.
