** Current Projects and Stuff

I currently work at [[http://radianlaser.com][Radian Laser Systems, LLC.]] on /embedded and distributed
systems/, /cloud automation/ and /Realtime Dashboards/ as a
contractor. I will /occaisonally/ take on an additional project if it
is a good fit and the schedule permits.

*** Streaming Video and Computer Vision

I am working on a /project/ called **RedEye** all about building a
network of cameras loaded with /AI/ algorithms and able to communicate
with one another and the outside world. 

**** TODO Put up RedEye Info page

*** Managing Predictable Software Projects

I have deemed myself the curator of what I am calling
[[/software][Predictable Software Practices]] that may interest you if you happen to
manage or pay for software development.
