# Cloud Automation

_Cloud_ support extends the reach of the data globally allowing access
to both _real-time_ and _historical datas_, it also expands the length
data can be kept. Rather than a couple weeks to a month per hub, the
data loaded in the cloud can be persisted for _years_ at very low
cost.

Entire fleets of hubs can be managed from the cloud console making it
easy to manage, monitor and update large deployments of not only
sensor station but also the _hubs_.
We are going to strive to managing all of our software update process
with total automation using modern _CI/CD_ techniques and
_Over-The-Air_ software updates. If we can hit this goal _and all goes
well_ we will be able to seamlessly roll out software with very little
human interaction.
