## Open Source / Open Tech 

- Go backend ~ small, FAST and easy to deploy
- VueJS Dashboard ~ styled with Paper it does not get any sexier
- REST API ~ it was designed to be part of an automation
- Web Sockets ~ makes the real-time dashboard not only possible, but
  exciting! 
- Ansible Deployment ~ It does not get any easy to deploy a complex
  environment with a nice clean ansible fired CI/CD pipeline
- Cloud Native ~ Our application(s) were designed to run as well in
  the cloud, a container or a baremetal host all the same!
