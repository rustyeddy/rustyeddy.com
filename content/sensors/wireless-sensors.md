Taking advantage of the esp32 Mesh Network, sophisticated power modes
allow these sensors to last for years before a battery change is
necessary, when battery power starts running low, the sensor will let
you know!

These sensors can be spread around in areas with little to no existing
network or internet connection. 

Over-The-Air updates make pushing updated and fixed software out to
devices as soon as new code has been released. No need to attaching
USB cables and doing firmware updates!
