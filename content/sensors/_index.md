  Sensor Station is a project to gather environmental data from
  inexpensive battery operated, wireless sensors. The data is 
  aggregated and accessible via a builtin Web Dashboard. The stations
  can be made globally accessible via a web account.

## What does sensor station do?

Sensor Station is a System rather than single application: we have a
set of battery powered, wireless sensors that transmit environmental
data (temperature, humidity, moisture and light) to a hub that serves
up this data on a real-time dashboard. Optionally, if and when an
Internet connection is available, the hub will stash it's local data
(_time-series_ database) in _the cloud_.
