# IoT Project Cloud

_Cloud_ support extends the reach of the data globally allowing access
to both _real-time_ and _historical datas_, it also expands the length
data can be kept. Rather than a couple weeks to a month per hub, the
data loaded in the cloud can be persisted for _years_ at very low
cost.

Entire fleets of hubs can be managed from the cloud console making it
easy to manage, monitor and update large deployments of not only
sensor station but also the _hubs_.
