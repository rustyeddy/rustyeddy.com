### Hub - Aggregate and care for sensors mesh network

The Sensor Data Aggregation Hub or just _Hub_ gathers data from all
sensors within it's _network_, makes that data available in
_real-time_ via _websockets_. 

The _Hub_ is also a _web server_ and will serve up an embedded web
allowing anybody authorized to watch data transmitted in
_real-time_. The _users_ can also access _historical_ data from the
more detailed _device_ and _data_ pages.

The _Hub_ also takes care of it's self organizing mesh network of
sensors. Finally the _Hub_ is the conduit between the dashboard and
the cloud.
