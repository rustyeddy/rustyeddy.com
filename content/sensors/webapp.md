## Dashboard WebApp

The dashboard is a WebUI built into the Hub providing a window into
your environmental health. All sensor data is transmitted over a
dedicated _MQTT_ _channel_, the channel is comprised of a _path_ that
looks like a _directory structure_ or URL path. Contained in the path
are the _identification_ of the device and the name of the _sensor_.

With this design, any _data publisher_ can contribute to the _Sensor
Station Application_.

### Mobile First

I have no doubt or argument with the _Mobile First_ discipline,
personally I still do most of my _browsing_ on a computer, not so much
a mobile phone.

Likewise, I don't normally build _mobile_ apps or _web pages_ until
now. 

It is quite obvious that mobile is huge and a very important game
changer. 

The reason I am biting the bullet and beginning the mobile development
is because of _Google Search Console_, it had switched modes to mobile
because it detected most of my website visitors are from mobile
devices. 

OK, I get the hint. That is why the IOT Station _dashboard_ will be
designed for _Mobile First_.
