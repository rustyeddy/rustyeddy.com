title: RedEye the Intelligent Video Network
date: 2021-07-22
description: >
  Take some inexpensive Raspberry Pi's and maybe a Jetson Nano or two
  and build applications around streaming video, Computer Vision and
  AI, then combine that with physical computing and you have a
  robotics application or an addition to your industrial manufacturing
  process. Want to build an object tracking video application?

RedEye was built from some common elements I used to build an _Automated
Irrigation System_ for my Organic Garden. I thought it would be
interesting to add a _Computer Vision_ algorithm for _"Pest
Detection_" (I'll let you know how that goes).

I have also been involved in similar application to add _Computer
Vision_ to an _Industrial Control System_ a very interesting topic,
but an entirely different conversation.

## RedEye is OpenSource

I started an OpenSource _"passion project"_ to use a network of
in-expensive cameras to make it easy to build really interesting, and
potentially world changing applications by adding some computer video
with some smarts.

You can think of RedEye, in a way as the combination of a network
_Security Camera_ system combined with an _Industrial Control System_
that can integrate Computer Vision and AI into an application.

## What is RedEye?

RedEye is a piece of software that runs on an inexpensive, networked,
Linux type of computer. A _Raspberry Pi_ or _NVidia Jetson Nano_ or a
_Laptop with built in camera_ can become a RedEye camera.

The RedEye _smart_ cameras have been to communicate with one another
as well as easily integrated into external control systems and
applications. 

That means a _RedEye_ application is not just about a single camera,
it is about application built on the collective intelligence of all
cameras in the network. 

## RedEye Features

1. Camera Control: complete control of video frames read from camera
2. WebUI with live video stream
3. Web UI to configure and monitor video stream
4. _Plugin Application_ with API's for _Computer Vision_, _GPIO_,
_MQTT_ and various other micro-controller style I/O support
5. MQTT messaging for Integration with real time applications
5. REST Interface for easy configuration and monitoring
6. Websockets for a RealTime dashboard. Not just live video, see
live sensor data as well.
7. Optional Private wireless networks independent of exiting Wifi
Infrastructure
