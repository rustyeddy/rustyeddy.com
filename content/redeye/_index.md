title: RedEye the Intelligent Video Network
date: 2021-07-22
description: >
  Take some inexpensive Raspberry Pi's and maybe a Jetson Nano or two
  and build applications around streaming video, Computer Vision and
  AI. Combine those ingredients with physical computing and you have a
  robotics application or an addition to your industrial manufacturing
  process.

## What is RedEye About?

RedEye is built from common elements I used to build an _Automated
Irrigation System_ for my Organic Garden. I thought it would be
interesting to add a _Computer Vision_ algorithm for _"Pest
Detection_" (I'll let you know how that goes).

RedEye makes the job of creating _streaming video applications_ with
_Artificial Intelligence_ and _Physical Computing_ significantly easier
than it is now.

### RedEye is OpenSource

I started an OpenSource _"passion project"_ to use a network of
in-expensive cameras to make it easy to build really interesting and
potentially world changing applications by adding some smarts to
multiple video streams.

You can think of RedEye sort of lika a combination of a network
_Security Camera_ system combined with an _Industrial Control System_
that integrates Computer Vision and AI into an application.

### Running RedEye

RedEye is just a piece of software that runs on most common _Linux_
computers with a camera. Either build or download the appropriate
image on one of the supported devices and start it up.

> TODO - Create images for download

Running RedEye is really just as easy as downloading it and starting
it up!

## What Makes RedEye so Cool?

The RedEye _smart_ cameras have a plugin system that will allow you
load one of our cool example applications, or of course create your
own! 

RedEye cameras know how to find one other, applications can be
programmed to manage one or more of these cameras. Standard network
management tools can be used to manage and troubleshoot cameras.

That means a _RedEye_ application is not just about a single camera,
it is about applications built on the collective intelligence of all
cameras in the network. 

### RedEye Features

1. Camera Control: complete control of video frames read from camera
2. WebUI with live video stream
3. Web UI to configure and monitor video stream
4. _Plugin Application_ with API's for _Computer Vision_, _GPIO_,
_MQTT_ and various other micro-controller style I/O support
5. MQTT messaging for Integration with real time applications
5. REST Interface for easy configuration and monitoring
6. Websockets provide RealTime data updates necessary for live dashboards
7. Optional Private wireless networks independent of exiting Wifi
