Orange County Low Vision is old-school when it comes to personal
customer service. According to Kelly Eddy, the owner of OCLV:

> "Many of our clients are well into their 80's and above, further more
> we typically do business in their homes. Trust is everything."

Since _Personal Service and Trust_ have always been the foundation
of OCLV "business" model, it is impairative the new _website project_
reflect the same personable reality, yet leverage the internet to the
benefit of the business and the client.

## Project Goals

So Kelly established a couple very **clear** but **simple** goals (my
favorite kind!):

1. Produce one additional sale per month.
2. Spend less time on the phone with customer support

A website, if _grown_ correctly should expose the company to a group
of _qualified_ potential clients that currently have no way of knowing
that OCLV can make their lives significantly better! Or that OCLV even
exists! 


1. That OCLV has products that help their needs
2. That OCLV even exists at all, they end up buying from a lessor or
   inappropriate vendor

## Project Results

The Website was launched in December of 2019, I am happy to say, OCLV
has acquired their very first, online client! Bravo, well done! We
plan on learning from this one and hopefully doubling that in the near
future!
