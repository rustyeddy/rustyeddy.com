Written with markdown, generated by hugo, styled by bootstrap and
hosted by github!  You can't beat this.

## Plain Text and Markdown

My primary goal with a _website framework_ was the ability to edit
content with my favorite text editor emacs! Markdown, happens to be a
very light weight, yet powerfull formatting tool that also _reads
well_ with plain text.

## Hugo Generates HTML5

[_Hugo_](http://gethugo.org) is a _static wesite generator_ that
converts the content I write in _markdown_ to the beautiful web pages
you are reading now.

## Styled with Bootstrap

[_Bootstrap_](http://getbootstrap.com) is a modern, _reactive_ _SCSS_
based website style frame work. It allows even a _non-designer_ like
me to produce pretty good looking websites out of the gate.

## Hosted by Github Pages

[_Github Pages_](github.com/pages) is a very quick and easy way to
integrate the content of this website into the corresponding public
HTML5 site you can see.
