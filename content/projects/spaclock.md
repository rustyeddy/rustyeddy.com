## Description

SPA Clock is an embedded webserver intended to run on a Rasberry Pi
(or similar linux system) with a touchscreen and Internet connection.

This clock comes with _Zero Touch configuration_. Just plug it in,
connect it to the internet and always have accurate time! 

> Even through power outages and timezone changes, you'll never have
> to reset your clock again.

Now wait, that is not all! You also get other cool things like the
date and current local weather!  

It is all OpenSource and easy to modify or extend with a simple yet
really powerful plugin system! 

## Open Source Technologies

SPAClock was built with current but proven technologies. It is
compact, easy to modify and a __great way__ to start developing modern
web applications.


SPA Clock was built with _industrial strength_ software development
_best practices_ to be fast, easy to use, reliable and safe. 

> SPAClock is **production ready**!

Here is the bulk of what was used to build this application:

- Go (the language) creates a tight, efficient micro-server
  - server static web pages and artifacts
  - REST API for various configuration and stuff
  - Websocket for realtime browser based perusing
  - MQTT for messaging between devices and controllers
- Vue.js for Front End application framework
- Cloud Automation for Deployment and Operations


## Why SPA Clock?

I started building the Single Page Application Internet Clock
(SPAClock) for two reasons: 

#### 1. Show Off (my Talents :)

To provide perspective clients with an unencumbered portfolio
example. 

In otherwords: my most complete and relevant work has been
for hire and hence, I can't provide more than a simple
description of the work.

#### 2. Learn Vue and Improve Frontend Skills

The other reason for SPAClock is that I wanted to learn Vue.js and
level up my _front end_ development skills.
