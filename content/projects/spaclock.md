## Description

SPA Clock is an embedded webserver intended to run on a Rasberry Pi
(or similar linux system) with a touchscreen and internet connection.

Not only does this bring you a _Zero Touch_ clock, just plug it in,
connect it to the internet and always have accurate time through power
outages and timezone changes, never reset your clock again.

> A clock that keeps **perfect** time and never needs to be reset!

That is out the gate, you also get other cool things like weather,
stock market or control your home lights and sound system..

It is all OpenSource and easy to modify or extend with a simple yet
really powerful plugin system!

## Technologies

SPAClock was built with all modern technologies. While SPAClock is
compact, easy to modify and a __great way__ to get start developing
modern web applications.

SPAClock is also built to be fast, easy to use and operate, reliable
and safe, in other words SPA clock was built with industrial strength
software development practices!

> SPAClock is **production ready**!

This modern web application is what is also referred to as a _Single
Page Application_ or _(SPA)_. Here is the bulk of what we used to
build this application:

- Go (the language) creates a tight, effecient micro-server
  - server static web pages and artifacts
  - REST API for various configuration and stuff
  - Websocket for realtime browser based perusing
  - MQTT for messaging between devices and controllers
- Vue.js for Front End
- Cloud Automation for Deployment


## Why SPA Clock?

I started building the Single Page Application Internet Clock
(SPAClock) for two reasons: provide perspective suitors with a live
and unemumbered portfolio example.

In otherwords, my most complete and relevant work has been for hire,
and hence I can not provide more than a simple description of work
I've done since much of it has never been public facing.

The other reason for SPAClock is that I wanted to learn Vue, seems
like some fun and I am being left out of all the
JavaScript/Webdev/frontend madness. :)
