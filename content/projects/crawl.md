This page is the _Software Requirements_ document, hence the
respective sections below.

## Goal and Requirement

The purpose of _crawl_ is to walk a website recording the response
rate from the server(s) and the reachability of every link on a given
page. 

The first iteration will provide a REST API and a Web UI with a form
and a page that displays the results of a single page walk.

## Ops Overview

The program _crawl_ can be run interactively as a command line tool
with appropriate arguments, it can also be run as a _daemon_,
listening for incoming URLs from the API
