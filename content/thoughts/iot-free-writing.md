This is my free-writing page for the IoT subject. It purpose is just
random brain dump streaming conciousness about whatever comes to mind
hopefully it is related to IoT and provides some powerful seeds to
create great articles and interesting projects.

I want to be able to generate incoming doing something that I Love
doing, I am reasonably good at and also something people are willing
to pay money for. 

I thought I would create an IoT project, something pretty simple yet
useful that will demonstrate quite a few different technologies
including, but not limited to:

1. Electronics
2. Embedded systems development
3. IoT Edge devices, conduct data and implement control systems.
4. Modern web development for UI and dashboards
5. Cloud computing
6. Security
7. Software development best practices

Start with something simple and grow from there.

I want to write about Iot but how can I approach this from an angle
that is not already been written about or that I can know something
about. 

    Disconnected stuff
