  I Design, Develop and Deliver Software

## In the Beginning

My interest in computer programming started with the Commodore 64
while I was attending L.A. Harbor Community College taking
classes to become a Mechanical Engineer. 

Soon after I transferred to CSU Long Beach I switched majors to
Computer Science, then just prior to graduating I took a job in
Aerospace.

## The Golden age of Aerospace

Employed as a Member of the Technical Staff at Rockwell Intl., Space
Systems Division I began managing a network of _Sun
Microsystems_ "engineering workstations" as they were called at the
time.

Soon after that I began programming embedded systems and real-time
applications. While working at Rockwell Intl. I started attending USC
for my masters degree where I focused on Computer Networks and
Distributed Systems.

## Institutionalized at USC

I left Rockwell to join a short lived startup called Retix Systems
where I lead a Q&A lab for routing protocols. From there I was offered
a position at _Information Sciences Institute_ at _USC_ where I engaged
in Multicast Routing research and developed of the earliest versions
of the _PIM_ multicast routing protocol.

## The Dotcom Craze and Cisco Systems

That lead to a five year gig as a Technical Lead at _Cisco Systems_ on
a brand new product called the _Core Routing System (CRS)_. At the time
time the hardware was being whiteboarded and we wrote source code from
scratch. 

I had been involved in the original development of MSDP, PIM, IGMP,
multicast forwarding and other interesting things. After the project
successfully went from R&D into production it was time to move on.

## Out on My Own

From Cisco I started my own consulting company where I have had the
chance to work with many diverse and interesting companies, projects
and people on a wide range of technologies. 

In the years that have passed I have worked on many interesting and
challenging projects with some interesting companies and great people.

However in all this time and array of problems I've been able to solve
Computer Networks and Embedded Systems remain my favorite type of
projects to work on.

## What About Now?

I still program almost everyday. Even though I have held titles such as
"_Principal Engineer_", "_Technical Lead_" and "_Senior
Systems Programmer_" among others I am most content when I am
programming or automating a cloud based project. 

I feel the most comfortable and alive when I am working on new
projects that may not be well defined. I thrive on turning complex
concepts and good ideas into real world working software.

## About This Website

This website was built for my [resume](/resume) and eventually other things. 

The content for this website was created with
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.com/markdown), then transformed to
_HTML pages_ with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) the _static site_
generator.

The site is minimally styled with [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
and hosted by [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). The source
for this site can be found at this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rustyeddy/rustyeddy.com).
