## About This Website

This website was built for my [resume](/resume) and eventually other things. 

The content for this website was created with
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.com/markdown), then transformed to
_html pages_ with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) the _static site_
generator.

The site is minimally styled with [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
and hosted by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). The source
for this site can be found at this [github repo](https://github.com/rustyeddy/rustyeddy.com).
