I am a software devloper.

Over the past 30+ years I have worked for large and small companies,
on large and small projects with both large and small teams.  I worked
on projects that have been a phenomenol successes and some that have
been abismal failures.

I enjoy, and in fact thrive on smaller teams with
moderate sized, but technically challenging projects.  Projects that
are often vague, chaotic and aggressively scheduled.

I love working on small teams building microservices and webapps,
despite the ambiguity and choas.  Somehow emerging from the insanity
with a useful and production cost shattering tool.

Like most _software engineers_, I love to jump right in and just start
coding. However, the years and many sleepless nights have tought
beyond a shadow of a dought, that the appropriate amount of time spent
doing the right activities (process) will be the factor determining
the success or failure of your project.

I have made it my mission to understand critical software lessons,
processes, patterns, best practices, from modern practices to the
runes of ancient lore.

My goal is to identify the process that a small software team can
follow, along with the people paying the bills and the end users
(otherwise known as _stakeholders_) can use with out slowing them
down.

Process and supporting tools that can be picked up quick by a new team
and new members, without bogging them down.  The process and tools
should make the team more efficient, more organized as well as
providing greater visibility to the owner and other stake holders. 

It should me it more fun for developers and other team members.

Everybody on the team know exactly where to find _everything_, rather
than sifting through folders on the computer, _dropbox_ or _evernote_,
forget about it if your start mixing _VM_'s in it.

Following the proper set of processes will also provide a great deal
of visibility to be useful for everybody on the project, but in
particular management and those paying the bills and juggle the
schedule. 

## Why

When I find a new client and want to start a working on a new project,
I can whip out my check lists, setup my infrastructure without busting
a sweat and busy solving problem and making the world a better place.

## Want to Share Your Thoughts?

Do you have any experience with building software, or ever have
a website or webapp built for yourself.  If so, I would love to ask,
and have you answer a couple quick questions, if you don't mind?

If you provide input, you will also get the scope on the results of
this surveying.

If you interested, but have not built an a webapp or website yet, but
are thinking about doing one soon, you should sign up too!  You can
also let me know if you have specific questions and I do my best to
get you the answers.  For great topics, hell, I'll write an article.

Cheers!
