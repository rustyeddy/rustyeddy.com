  I Design, Develop and Deliver Software
---

I have been building software for over three decades. I practice the
_Art of Computer Programming_ and _Systems Architecture_ on a daily. 
I enjoy _backend programmer_,  _real-time systems_ and _IoT
projects_.

I live in Huntington Beach, California with my family. I can usually
be found in, on or around the Pacific Ocean when I am not engaged in
business, and even when I am doing business. 

## About This Website

This website was built for my [resume](/resume) and eventually other things. 

The content for this website was created with
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.com/markdown), then transformed to
_html pages_ with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) the _static site_
generator.

The site is minimally styled with [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
and hosted by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). The source
for this site can be found at this [github repo](https://github.com/rustyeddy/rustyeddy.com).
