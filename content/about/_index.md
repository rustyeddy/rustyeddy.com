  I Design, Develop and Deliver Software

I am a Software Engineer and IIoT hacker. I specialize in systems
architecture, software process, robotics and industrial laser
engravers and cuttes.

See my [resume](http://rustyeddy.com/resume) for current work
situation [Radian Laser Systems, LLC](http://radianlaser.com).

> realtime communication at massive scale.

I like to develop software for physical systems using
micro-controllers (Raspberry PI, esp32 and Arduino), realtime
communications (i2c, websockets, MQTT), and embedded firmware.

I am equally experienced with the challenges of _Systems Engineering_
managing interconnected networks of IoT device hardware, which involve
heavy doses of cloud automation and systems administration.

> I stay up to date on emerging technologies and adapt as necessary,

> shiny. 

Languages and Technologies I work with regularly include (but not
limited to): 

- Go, REST API & Websockets
- C/C++, TCP/IP, Computer Networks and Routing
- Reactive front ends with JavaScript and Vue.
- Python, Flask and lots of different packages 
- Cloud Automation with Digital Ocean, GCP & AWS.
- Linux and Open Source

## This Website

This website was built for my [resume](/resume) and eventually other things. 

The content for this website was created with
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.com/markdown), then transformed to
_html pages_ with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) the _static site_
generator.

The site is minimally styled with [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
and hosted by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). The source
for this site can be found at this [github repo](https://github.com/rustyeddy/rustyeddy.com).
