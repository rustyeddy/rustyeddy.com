I am a Software Engineer and Team Leader. I specialize in systems
architecture and improving the software process for companies in the
Robotics, IoT and Manufacturing space.

I live in Huntington Beach CA, with my family, contribute to maker
projects and tinker with home and vehical automation when I am not
surfing. 

Early in my programming life I became fascinated with computer
networks and the idea that I could connect two or more computers and
make them talk to each other.

I enjoy developing software for physical systems using
micro-controllers (Raspberry PI, Arduino, esp32), realtime
communications (i2c, websockets, MQTT), and embedded firmware.

I am equally fascinated with the challenges of managing interconnected
networks of IoT devices, which involve heavy doses of cloud
automation and systems administration.

Languages and Technologies I work with regularly include (but not
limited to): 

- Go, REST API & Websockets
- C/C++, TCP/IP, Computer Networks and Routing
- Reactive front ends with JavaScript and Vue.
- Python, Flask and lots of different packages 
- Cloud Automation with Digital Ocean, GCP & AWS.
- Linux and Open Source

## This Website

This website was built for my [resume](/resume) and eventually other things. 

The content for this website was created with
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.com/markdown), then transformed to
_html pages_ with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) the _static site_
generator.

The site is minimally styled with [bootstrap](http://getboostrap.io)
and hosted by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). The source
