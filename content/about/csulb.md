I started majoring in mechanical engineer, but eventually switched
over to the newly formed _computer science_ department after reading
an article in one of the old surf rags (RIP) _Surfing_ or _Surfer_
where a fellow descriped his job programming video games while he
lived on the beach and would surf when the waves got good.

The following day I went to school and changed my major. At the time
IBM PC's had started rolling out and I had acquired the Borland Turbo
Pascal 2.0 just as I was building my Fortran chops, Pascal was my
first exposure to a _structured_ programming language.

I finally graduated..
