  What can I say, we met in Long Beach, we went to CSULB and now live
  a short 20 minute drive North of HB past scenic coastal towns of
  Sunset Beach and Seal Beach and you have every big city emenity you
  want with a very neighborly feel for sure!

## Night Life and Food

Long Beach is a pretty big city, _fifth largest_ in California. You
can certainly find many different sections with great food, music,
night clubs and all.

## Water Activities

Boating is big in Long Beach. Due to the breakwalls and protected
nature of the bay, ocean swells and surfing are not really part of the
Long Beach **beach** scene, however water activies are an essential
part of the economy with the Second Largest Port in the US Long
Beach) adjacent to the Largest port in the US Los Angeles sees the
largest commercial shipping traffic in the United States.

The biggest of cruise ships, cargo containers Yachts, Sail boats,
water craft and hmmm. I'm forgetting something...

Oh yea, _world class deep see fishing_ just off the coast.
