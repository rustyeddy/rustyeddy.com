  We live in Huntington Beach California which is a great for active
  outdoor activities. What makes this even more exciting is that many
  of our neighboring cities are outstanding places to hang out as
  well.

We are so lucky to have access to a lifetime of adventures, entertainment
and things to do in this little section of the world. We wanted to
start documenting our day trips (and maybe a couple overnighters)
around our home town in of Huntington Beach and beyond.

## Neighboring Cities - North

To the north, with less than a half hour drive we have _Sunset Beach_,
_Seal Beach_ and _Long Beach_ then all of _Los Angeles_ and everything
_LA_ has to offer.

## Neighboring Cities - South

To the south within half an hour we have _Costa Mesa_, _Newport
Beach_, _Laguna Beach_ just a short _beautiful_ drive a bit further
south we have the _South County_ beach cities, terminating is the
beautiful _San Clemente_.

Keep going another half hour and you will be in the San Diego
county. Nuff said.

> Did I mention there is world class _Surfing through out this
  area?_say Surfing! Well that is a whole conversation all it's own!

## Outdoor

Things to do outdoor include every form of water sport. The _Pacific
Ocean_ is a heck of place to spend time on the water, be it: swimming,
surfing, Kayak, SUP, Sail, Dive or Gaze mindlessly at her greatness.

## Indoor

Foodie? We got great food. I can't lie Taco's will always be my
favorite food, and nowhere (sans Mexico) can a better taco be found
than here in the _South Land_!

We got it all. Big dollar fancy and Food Trucks are close by.

Just in case you didn't know, we even like to eat food and listen to
music outside! That is by far the best way to spend time in OC,
outside. Even in the winter!

## Forget the malls.

I won't have much to say about Disneyland or other ***wonderful***
tourist attractions, since I haven't been in a couple decades.

I hope I can put together a few interesting, and hopefully slightly
alternate things to do, places to eat and stay than you may otherwise
find in the _Beaten Path_ guides.

## A Locals' Guide

However, I have surfed, ate at, hung out in or drank a beer in most
every beach town between Santa Barbara and the Mexican Border. I have
my favorites sections and areas I avoid, but I LOVE the _Southern
California Coast_.

## I Started Sailing

I plan to Sail as much of this Southern California Coast as God and
Nature permit. It will be fascinating to see this entire stretch of
coast from the Pacific Ocean!

Your in OC, what do _you_ want to do?
