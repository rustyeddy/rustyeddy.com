I bought a starter 3D printer kit with the intentions of turning my
Dremel [Todo Insert Pic] into a Robot! We'll being controlled by a
Robot anyway.  

## Electronics and Motors Kit

The bunch came as a kit for about $62 USD, the kit included:

- Imitation Arduino
- _CH340G CNC Shield v3.0_ for Arduino
- _DRV8825 Stepper Motor Drivers_ +4
- _Nema 17 Stepper Motors with Mounts_ +3 (m3 screws)
- _End Piece Limit Switches_ +3

## The Pololu DRV8825 Motor Drivers

Resources:

- [Pololu DRV8825 Motor Driver Carrier High Current](https://www.pololu.com/product/2133)
- [DRV8825 Datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv8825.pdf) from Texas Instruments

This is the breakout board for TIâ€™s DRV8825 microstepping bipolar
stepper provided with the kit (from Pololu). It features:

- adjustable current limiting
- over-current and over-temprature protection
- six microstep resolutions (down to 1/32-step)
- It operates froom 8.2v to 45v
- Can deliver up to approximately 1.5 A per phase without a heat sink or forced air flow
  (rated for up to 2.2 A per coil with sufficient additional cooling)

[TODO: place the pinouts from the motor drivers.]
