Includes sketches that do the following:

- esp8266 codes that have been built using the Arduino IDE

- LCD w/out Keypad for controlling 16x2 LCD outputs on projects that
  benefit from an inexpensive but flexible display output.
  
- Mobile Robot balancer software, includes feedback signals from an
  MPU6050 gyroscope/accelloramter, motor rotation decoders, controlled
  by a web app or blue tooth.
