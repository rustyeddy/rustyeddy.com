## The IoT Project

I started this project as a portfolio piece to enhance my
[resume](/resume) and to automate my home sprinkler system and stop by
boat from leaking.

Both of these problems can be solved by this same project a couple
slightly different configurations. This is a very simple framework for
building IoT products. 

If you are interested in the _Organic Gardner_ IoT project, or you are
interested in the ins and outs of _IoT_ software development follow
the link below and get involved!
