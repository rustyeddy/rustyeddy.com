### Welcome to my Site!

This site is mostly about my professional self, what I have
accomplished in the past, what I am working on now and what I am
excited about working on as we get past 2020!

Here you can find my [resume](/resume) as well as a
[portfolio](/projects) with just a *couple* of the projects that I
have worked on during my career.  If you are interested in working
with me, have a look at those two pages they are a good place to start.

### Below the surface

I would also like to use the rest of this website to communicate at a
level or two _deeper_ about _who I am_, what I _have done_, am
_currently_ working on now and finally what I am excited about,
_technology wise_ as we move past 2020.

> I will give you a hint: it has to do with IoT, Networking and
> distrubted, embedded systems.

### Automation and Control

I currently work at [Radian Laser Systems, LLC](resume/clients/radian-laser)
on various software componenets, I report to the VP of Engineering
with responsibility for the entire software lifecycle from
architecture, development and support.

The software is a realtime, embedded system with many independent
working parts that must be choreographed in real-time communications 
while ensuring the saftey of the people and equipment itself.

### The Cloud and Intuitive User Interfaces

In the process of building this modern, but rather large _"IoT"_ device,
we are working through the challenges of managing and automating
backend support systems and building intuitive Human Displays or GUI's.

But as of this writing I keep myself busy with the addition of the
_Sensor Station_ project described below.

### Sensor Station Earth Automation

[Sensor Station](https://github.com/sensorstation/station) is my pet
project that gets a lot of my attention, when I can carve out the
time. 

The project is an _Automated Gardening Application_ that I started for
two reasons:
 
1. I wanted to find a practical way to grow some of my own food in my
   very small _coastal southern california_ backyard.
2. I wanted a 100% OpenSource piece of software (as it turns out
   pieces of software) that could use for my portfolio.
   
While I have worked (and used) _Open Source_ software long before the
term _Open Source_ had been invented, however:

> most of my significant programming accomplishments have been as a
> paid employee working on closed or proprietary systems.

Since I can not really get into any detailed discussion, show source
code nor build on these [significant] hunks of previous work.

#### All Open Source

Sensor Station serves, for me, a way to display my _programming_
and _design_ skills as well as my architectural thought process, all
while building a useful app.

I know this is going to sound like some pretty heavy syrup, however

I would really like to hear what you have to think.!.
