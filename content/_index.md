I am a Sofware Engineer and Programmer for Hire. I built this website
for my [resume](/resume), and eventually other things.

This website was built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.com/markdown). _Hugo_ creates _static
websites_ that are really fast, super easy to host and manage, [check
em out](https://gohugo.io/)!
