### Checkout IoT Project Sensor Station!

I started this journey to automate my home garden irrigation system, 
then I had problem with my boat almost flooding so I needed to solve the
problem of NOT flooding the boat before watering the garden.

The cool part is that both systems require about 90% of the same
technology, just a little bit of change to the _business logic_ to
_re-purpose_ my _Boat Flooding Avoidance System (BFAS)_ to an _Organic
Garden Irrigation System (OGIS)_.

With that in mind I decided to give the underlying project a little
more of a generic, if even boring new name of _IoT Sensor
Station_ (ISS). I put the IoT in hoping to get a little _search
juice!_

New and novel applications are easily built with the core ISS,
two examples are the projects above.

Follow along with Sensor station, get involved if you like... Go
[IoT Project](/iot-project)!
