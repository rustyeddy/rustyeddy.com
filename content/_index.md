I have always been fascinated with the idea that computers could
_"talk"_ to one another, I was part of the computer network revolution
and now am even more interested in the idea of communicating with the
_"physical"_ world, or what we now call Ineternet of Things (IoT).
It is my goal to apply my knowledge of software and electronic
communications to help improve this world.

I am very interested in developing a software project that includes
environmental improvement, industrial automation and general IoT.

My favorite projects to work on involve taking novel ideas, sometimes
not clearly fleshed out and implementing useful software systems to
realize the benefits of innovative thinking.

## IoT Software Project - Organic Gardner

I started this project was started to help my wife water her rather
extensive succulent collection. Then I figured I may as well polish it
up a bit and use it as a portfolio piece to go along with my
[resume](/resume).

If you are responsible for adding software to one of your product
lines or a developer interested in some of the interesting nuances
that goe along with _Physical Computing_ and _IoT_ projects. Please
join me on this journey [IoT GatewayProject](/iote).
