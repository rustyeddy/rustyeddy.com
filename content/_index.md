I like to write software that makes hardware **talk**
(computer networks), **move** (Robotics) and **see** (computer
vision). 

## RedEye - The Intelligent Video Network

RedEye is a Streaming Video framework with _Computer Vision_ pipelines. It allows
you to dynamically control and view a network of video cameras allowing AI computer
vision filters to be swapped dynamically.  Live video streams, snapshots or pre-recorded
videos can be fed into the RedEye VN. 

RedEye consists of the following software components:

- Camera software: _M-JPEG Streamer_ with _Computer Vision_
- Real-Time Video Hub: _Serve Up Web App_ with _real time_ data over _websockets_
- APP / WebUI that displays video stream filtered with AI pipelines in Real-Time.

If you are interested in _streaming video_, _computer vision_ and
seeing real software being developed now, RedEye just might grab your
interest!

## How To Write Predicable Software

I have been writing software for nearly 3 decades (sheesh), I have
been part of some massive failures and a few great successes and a
variety of _delivered_ projects of various quality.

I have started this little project to collect and document what I
consider my "Best Practices" for delivering exactly the software that
is needed in a timely and **predictable** manner.

With *your help*, I hope to make them useful for more than just
myself, but anybody running a small development project. Like you,
maybe?  :)

If your interested and would like to comment, check out my [Software Best Practices Project](/software) and let me 
know what you think?
