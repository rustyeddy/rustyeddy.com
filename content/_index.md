## An Interview with Me

In almost every interview I have done involved a series of questions
that pretty much follow the pattern below.  So I thought I would
create a mock Interview with myself, anticipating the questions that
you might have for me. 

Now, If you actually have a different question or questions, please,
by all means do contact me using the adjecent form (or any other way
you would like).

### So, tell me, who are you?

My name is George Eddy, my friends call me Rusty.  I live in
Huntington Beach, CA with my family.  I was born and raised in
Southern California, Educated at CSULB and USC. I have worked in the
Aerospace Industry, Computer Networking, Telecom and the Entertainment
Industries. 

#### What do you do?

I am Software Engineer and Network architect. I still write a lot of
software, and these days, I am particularly interested in robots,
embedded systems and computer vision.  

I like working on hard problems with talented people.


#### What have you worked on in the past?

Lot's of really cool things, some big complex projects as well as
interesting proof of concept research projects.  

Most of these involve computer networks, Real Time applications
and/or high availability services.  There are plenty of other
things that I have built, but these are what I consider my "Core
Strengths". 

#### What Roles and Titles have you had?

Principal Engieer, Technical Lead, Member of The Technical Staff,
Senior Software Engineer and Systems Programmer are some of my
previous Job titles.

I throughouly enjoy being a technical lead, mentoring Jr. engineers and high level
architecture.  However, I am also a very hands on programmer.

#### And who have you worked for?
I have worked for Fortune 500 companies including AT&T, Cisco Systems,
McDonnel Douglas (now Boeing) and USC/ISI.

I have also worked with startups and small businesses.  I really enjoy
early stage projects and small agile teams of diverse and talented
people.

#### Do you have a Resume, or a Portfolio?

I sure do, and it is online!  For the particular dates, titles and
projects you can get more detail here:
