#### About Me

I am a Sofware Engineer and Team Leader for Hire. I specialize in
systems architecture and improving the software process for companies
in the Robotics, IoT and Manufacturing space.

I enjoy developing software for physical systems using
micro-controllers (Raspberry PI, Arduino, esp32), realtime
communications (i2c, websockets, MQTT), and embedded firmware.

IoT has me doing a lot of cloud automation and systems administration
as well as solving some interesting operational challenges with fleet
management.

Languages and Technologies I work with regularly include (but not
limited to): Go, REST API & Websockets, JavaScript and Vue. Python and
Flask. TCP/IP, Ansible, Digital Ocean, GCP & AWS. 

I live in Huntington Beach CA, with my family, contribute to maker
projects and tinker with home and vehical automation when I am not
surfing. 

#### This Website

This website was built for my [resume](/resume), and eventually other things. 

This website content was created mostly with
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.com/markdown) transformed into a
_static html website_ with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) the _static
website_ generator. 

The site is minimally styled with [bootstrap](http://getboostrap.io)
and hosted by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). The source
for this site can be found in this [github repo](https://github.com/rustyeddy/rustyeddy.com).
