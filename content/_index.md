Three plus decades have left me with a lot of experience with
successful software projects and dismal failures. Over time, I have
attempted to build a set of _Best Practices_ I can rely on as I attack
new software projects.

I have started this little project to do a *much* better job of
documenting these "Best Practices" and with *your help*, I hope to
make them useful for more than myself.
