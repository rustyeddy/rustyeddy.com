## The IoT Project

I started this project as a portfolio piece to enhance my
[resume](/resume)and also to automate my home garden and stop my boat
from sinking.

Both problems can be solved by the same application with slightly
different configurations. This is a very simple framework for building
IoT products. 

If this sounds interesting or you would like to get an insiders view
of what it is like to design, deliver and deploy a complete IoT
software system, join me.
