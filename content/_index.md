I like to write software that likes to make hardware **talk**
(computer networks), **move** (Robotics) and **see** (computer
vision). 

## RedEye - The Intelligent Video Network

- Camera software: _M-JPEG Streamer_ with _Computer Vision_
- Real-Time Video Hub: _Serve Up Web App_ with _real time_ data over _websockets_
- APP / WebUI that displays video stream filtered with AI pipelines in Real-Time.

## How To Write Predicable Software

I have started this little project to do a *much* better job of
documenting these "Best Practices" and with *your help*, I hope to
make them useful for more than just myself, but anybody running a
small development project. Like you, maybe?  :)

If your interested and would like to comment, check out my [Software Best Practices Project](/software) and let me 
know what you think?
