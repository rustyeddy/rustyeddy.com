#### About Me

I am a Sofware Engineer for Hire. I specialize in systems architecture
and software design and leading teams.  However, I also program pretty
much every day because it is what I love to do.

I specialize in developing software for physical systems. Things like
micro-controllers, realtime communications, firmware. IoT has me doing
a lot of cloud automation as well.

I live in Huntington Beach CA, with my family, contribute to maker
projects and tinker with home and vehical automation when I am not
surfing. 

#### This Website

This website was built for my [resume](/resume), and eventually other things. 

This website content was created mostly with
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.com/markdown) transformed into a
_static html website_ with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the _static
website_ generator. 

The site is minimally styled with [bootstrap](http://getboostrap.io)
and hosted by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). The site is
served from [the same repository] as the sources for the
(https://github.com/rustyeddy/rustyeddy.com).
