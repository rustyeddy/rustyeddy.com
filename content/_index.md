I have always been fascinated with the idea that computers could
_"talk"_ to one another (computer networking) and now I am even more
interested in the concept that little tiny computers can observe and
alter the real or _"physical"_ world (IoT) and also talk to each
other!

It is my goal to apply my knowledge of software and electronic
communications to help improve this world. I am particularly
interested in enviromnmental cleanup and industrial automation
projects.

Interested in a particular topic?  I have written quite a bit about

1. [IOT](./iot)
2. [Software](./software)
3. [My self](./about)
4. And have taken a few [Notes](./notes)
5. Finally I also have a reasonably outdated [Resume](./resume)
