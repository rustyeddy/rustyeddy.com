## The IoT Project

I started this project as a portfolio piece to enhance my
[resume](/resume) and to automate my home sprinkler system and stop by
boat from leaking.

Both of these problems can be solved by this same project a couple
slightly different configurations. This is a very simple framework for
building IoT products. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
For this project I will use modern _Best Practices_ in _Software
Architecture_, _System Design_ and the _Software Development
Lifecycle (SDLC)_. 
=======
If this sounds interesting or you would like to get an insiders view
of what it is like to design, deliver and deploy a complete IoT
software system, join me.
