### Checkout IoT Project Sensor Station!

I started a journey to autmote my home garden irrigation system, then
I had problem with my boat almost flooding so I needed to solve the
problem of NOT flooding the boat before watering the garden.

The cool part is, both systems require about 90% of the same
technology, just a little bit of change to the _business logic_ and I
can _repurpose_ the software.

With that in mind I decided to give the underlying project a little
more of a generic name. The applications can be called what they
will. 

The project is all about gather data from sensors, feeding the data
into a control system and/or saving for historical reference. With a
dashboard and cloud arhcive all thrown in.
