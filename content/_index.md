I have always been fascinated with the idea that computers could
_"talk"_ to one another (computer networking) and now I am even more
interested in the concept that little tiny computers can observe and
alter the real or _"physical"_ world (IoT).

It is my goal to apply my knowledge of software and electronic
communications to help improve this world. I am particularly
interested in enviromnmental and industrial automation projects.
