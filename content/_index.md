Software that likes to make hardware **talk**
(computer networks), **move** (Robotics) and **see** (computer
vision). 

I have started this little project to do a *much* better job of
documenting these "Best Practices" and with *your help*, I hope to
make them useful for more than just myself, but anybody running a
small development project. Like you, maybe?  :)

Check out my [Software Best Practices Project](/software) and let me
know what you think?
