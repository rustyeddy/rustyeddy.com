  I Design, Develop and Deliver Software

I am a Software Engineer and Team Leader for Hire. I specialize in
systems architecture and improving the software process for companies
in the Robotics, IoT and Manufacturing space.

Early in my programming life I became fascinated with computer
networks and the idea that you could have two computers connected to a
telecom line and send message back and forth, or essentially "talk" to
one another.

I enjoy developing software for physical systems using
micro-controllers (Raspberry PI, Arduino, esp32), realtime
communications (i2c, websockets, MQTT), and embedded firmware.

I am equally fascinated with the challenges of managing networks of
these devices. IoT involves a lot of cloud automation and systems
administration as well as solving some interesting operational
challenges with fleet management.

Languages and Technologies I work with regularly include (but not
limited to): 

- Go, REST API & Websockets
- C/C++, TCP/IP, Computer Networks and Routing
- Reactive front ends with JavaScript and Vue.
- Python, Flask and lots of different packages 
- Cloud Automation with Digital Ocean, GCP & AWS.
- Linux and Open Source

I live in Huntington Beach CA, with my family, contribute to maker
projects and tinker with home and vehical automation when I am not
surfing. 

## This Website

This website was built for my [resume](/resume), and eventually other things. 

This website content was created mostly with
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.com/markdown) transformed into a
_static html website_ with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) the _static
website_ generator. 

The site is minimally styled with [bootstrap](http://getboostrap.io)
and hosted by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). The source
for this site can be found in this [github repo](https://github.com/rustyeddy/rustyeddy.com).
