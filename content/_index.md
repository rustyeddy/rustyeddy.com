## How To Build an IoT Project

I started this journey to automate my home garden irrigation system, 
then I had problem with my boat almost flooding so I needed to solve the
problem of NOT flooding the boat before watering the garden.

The cool part is that both systems require about 90% of the same
functionality, just a little bit of change to the business logic to
re-purpose the code for my _Boat Flooding Avoidance System (BFAS)_ to 
an _Organic Garden Irrigation System (OGIS)_.

With that in mind I decided to give the underlying project a little
more of a generic if even boring new name of _IoT Sensor
Station_ (ISS). 

New and novel applications are easily built with the core ISS,
two examples are the projects above.

Follow along with Sensor station, get involved if you like... or just
learn the many aspects of designing and building an 
[IoT Project](/iot-project-sensor-station)!
