I will work with you on Design, Implementation and Deployment of
service or services you are in need of.  I work primarily with
[go](http://golang.org) and occaisionally _Python_.
<!--more-->

I can develop services that provide (as well as consume)

- REST API
- GraphQL
- Websocket
- MQTT
- General Sockets

## Additional Information

When developing micro services we also need to consider are the
logging system(s), acceptance tests and deployment.
