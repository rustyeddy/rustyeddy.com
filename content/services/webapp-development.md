My User Interface development goto solution is a webapp (HTML, CSS &
JavaScript), to this end, I do not specialize on any popular frame
work per se, rather I prefer to build smaller solutions that address
particular problems, I am typically transparent with the connections
to databases and other external services.

## Front End Work

I build webapp for IoT devices, for example a dashboard on a 6"
Raspberry Pi, like the one below.  If you have, or a build a backend
set of APIs, and need a dashboard on a Raspberry Pi touch panel. 

- Bootstrap
- Vue.js
- Websocket
- Static Front Ends by Hugo
- Content with Markdown
